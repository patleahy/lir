<p>I enjoy turning mathematical concepts into wearable pieces of art. That’s the idea behind my business, <a href='https://hanusadesign.com' target=_blank rel=noopener>Hanusa Design</a>. I make unique products that feature striking designs inspired by the beauty and precision of mathematics. These pieces are created using the range of functionality in the <a href='https://www.wolfram.com/language/'>Wolfram Language</a>. Just in time for Valentine’s Day, we recently launched <a href='https://wolfr.am/earrings'>Spikey earrings in the Wolfram Store</a>, which are available in rose gold&ndash;plated brass and red nylon. In this blog, I’ll give a look under the hood and discuss how an idea becomes a product through the Wolfram Language.<span id="more-71971"></span></p>
<p style="display: inline-block; float: right; margin-left: 8px; margin-top: 5px;"><a href='https://store.wolfram.com/view/misc/#rosegold-earring'><img class="bookpost" src="https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/39/2021/02/close-up.png" alt="Spikey earring" title="Spikey earring" width="290" height=""/></a></p>
<p>First, we&#8217;ll go through a tutorial of how to create a pair of mathematical earrings. In the second half of this post, I&#8217;ll share the mathematics and Wolfram Language commands behind some of my favorite designs.</p>
<h2 id='creating-a-pair-of-dodecahedron-earrings'>Creating a Pair of Dodecahedron Earrings</h2>
<p></p>
<p>Every item at Hanusa Design has been 3D modeled in <a href='https://www.wolfram.com/mathematica/'>Wolfram Mathematica</a> and then 3D printed to bring the jewelry to life. At the heart of a number of designs is polyhedral geometry, easily accessible in the Wolfram Language through the <tt><a href='http://reference.wolfram.com/language/ref/PolyhedronData.html'>PolyhedronData</a></tt> command. For example, here is a dodecahedron:</p>
<table class='InCell'>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td colspan='1' rowspan='1' class='Input'>
<div>
					<img class='' src="https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/39/2021/02/ch0215img1-1.png" alt='Show' title='Show' width='398' height='' />
				</div>
<div class='IFL'>
					<span class='close' id='1_out'>&amp;#10005</span></p>
<pre class='text' id='1_out_text'>Show[PolyhedronData["Dodecahedron"], Boxed -&gt; False]</pre>
</p></div>
</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p><tt>PolyhedronData</tt> also puts at your fingertips the coordinates of the vertices, edges and faces of the polyhedron, which makes creating a wireframe version of the dodecahedron a snap: </p>
<table class='InCell'>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td colspan='1' rowspan='1' class='Input'>
<div>
					<img class='' src="https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/39/2021/02/ch0215img2-1.png" alt='vertices = PolyhedronData' title='vertices = PolyhedronData' width='535' height=' ' />
				</div>
<div class='IFL'>
					<span class='close' id='2_out'>&amp;#10005</span></p>
<pre class='text' id='2_out_text'>vertices = PolyhedronData["Dodecahedron", "VertexCoordinates"];
edges = Map[vertices[[#]] &, 
   PolyhedronData["Dodecahedron", "EdgeIndices"]];
wireframe = 
 Graphics3D[{Map[Tube[#, .1] &, edges], Map[Sphere[#, .1] &, edges]}, 
  Boxed -&gt; False]</pre>
</p></div>
</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>In the previous code, <tt>"EdgeIndices"</tt> refers to vertex pairs that make up the set of edges. We require both the <tt><a href='http://reference.wolfram.com/language/ref/Tube.html'>Tube</a></tt> command to create the edges of the wireframe and the <tt><a href='http://reference.wolfram.com/language/ref/Sphere.html'>Sphere</a></tt> command to complete the corners in order for the result to be 3D printable. The model is ready to be exported to one of the formats that 3D printers need:</p>
<table class='InCell'>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td colspan='1' rowspan='1' class='Input'>
<div>
					<img class='' src="https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/39/2021/02/ch0215img3.png" alt='Export' title='Export' width='440' height='21' />
				</div>
<div class='IFL'>
					<span class='close' id='3_out'>&amp;#10005</span></p>
<pre class='text' id='3_out_text'>Export[NotebookDirectory[] &lt;&gt; "dodecahedron.stl", wireframe]</pre>
</p></div>
</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>The resulting file can now be 3D printed. However, at this point we should probably pay attention to the size and finishing of the object. I have found that reimporting an STL file is one of the best ways to ensure that Mathematica is working with a well-behaved object:</p>
<table class='InCell'>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td colspan='1' rowspan='1' class='Input'>
<div>
					<img class='' src="https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/39/2021/02/ch0215img4-1.png" alt='imported = Import' title='imported = Import' width='429' height=' ' />
				</div>
<div class='IFL'>
					<span class='close' id='4_out'>&amp;#10005</span></p>
<pre class='text' id='4_out_text'>imported = Import[NotebookDirectory[] &lt;&gt; "dodecahedron.stl"]</pre>
</p></div>
</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>The imported model is a <tt><a href='http://reference.wolfram.com/language/ref/MeshRegion.html'>MeshRegion</a></tt> object, which means that we can apply region transformation commands. For instance, the standard dimensions for an STL file are in millimeters, so if we want a dodecahedron earring that is 2cm in width, we should resize the imported region to be 20mm wide:</p>
<table class='InCell'>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td colspan='1' rowspan='1' class='Input'>
<div>
					<img class='' src="https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/39/2021/02/ch0215img5-1.png" alt='mmscale = RegionResize' title='mmscale = RegionResize' width='277' height=' ' />
				</div>
<div class='IFL'>
					<span class='close' id='5_out'>&amp;#10005</span></p>
<pre class='text' id='5_out_text'>mmscale = RegionResize[imported, 20]</pre>
</p></div>
</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>While one can attach an <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earwire' target=_blank rel=noopener>earwire</a> directly to this wireframe dodecahedron, I prefer to add a ring dedicated for that purpose. I&#8217;ll also use <tt><a href='http://reference.wolfram.com/language/ref/TransformedRegion.html'>TransformedRegion</a></tt> and <tt><a href='http://reference.wolfram.com/language/ref/RotationTransform.html'>RotationTransform</a></tt> twice to rotate our resized model so the ring can be attached at the top of the polyhedron. Pro tip: I figured out the angle I needed to rotate it on the <em>y</em> axis by applying <tt><a href='http://reference.wolfram.com/language/ref/ArcTan.html'>ArcTan</a></tt> to the dodecahedron vertex that had a zero <em>y</em> coordinate:</p>
<table class='InCell'>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td colspan='1' rowspan='1' class='Input'>
<div>
					<img class='' src="https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/39/2021/02/ch0215img6-7.png" alt='angle = -ArcTan' title='angle = -ArcTan' width='483' height='89' />
				</div>
<div class='IFL'>
					<span class='close' id='6_out'>&amp;#10005</span></p>
<pre class='text' id='6_out_text'>angle = -ArcTan[vertices[[16, 3]], vertices[[16, 1]]];
					rotated = 
  TransformedRegion[
   TransformedRegion[mmscale, RotationTransform[angle, {0, 1, 0}]], 
   RotationTransform[Pi/2, {0, 0, 1}]];</pre>
</p></div>
</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>The ring is created by using a <tt><a href='http://reference.wolfram.com/language/ref/ParametricPlot3D.html'>ParametricPlot3D</a></tt> command to draw a circular path. This has been converted into a torus by using <tt>Tube</tt> as a <tt><a href='http://reference.wolfram.com/language/ref/PlotStyle.html'>PlotStyle</a></tt> option. Specifying the number of <tt><a href='http://reference.wolfram.com/language/ref/PlotPoints.html'>PlotPoints</a></tt> ensures that the ring is smooth instead of faceted:</p>
<table class='InCell'>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td colspan='1' rowspan='1' class='Input'>
<div>
					<img class='' src="https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/39/2021/02/ch0215img8-1.png" alt='ring = ParametricPlot3D' title='ring = ParametricPlot3D' width='466' height=' ' />
				</div>
<div class='IFL'>
					<span class='close' id='8_out'>&amp;#10005</span></p>
<pre class='text' id='8_out_text'>ring = ParametricPlot3D[
   1.7 {Cos[x], 0, Sin[x]} + {0, 0, 11.2}, {x, 0, 2 Pi}, 
   PlotStyle -&gt; Tube[.5, PlotPoints -&gt; 30], PlotPoints -&gt; 40];
earring = Show[rotated, ring, PlotRange -&gt; All]</pre>
</p></div>
</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>Since we&#8217;ve mixed a region with a <tt>ParametricPlot3D</tt> object, I&#8217;ll export and reimport so I can make a second earring copy with <tt><a href='http://reference.wolfram.com/language/ref/TranslationTransform.html'>TranslationTransform</a></tt>:</p>

<p>This 3D model can now be uploaded to a 3D printing service and printed just for you, just like <a href='http://shpws.me/SwFg' target=_blank rel=noopener>the pair you can order here</a>. </p>

<p>3D-printed jewelry seems to inhabit a sweet spot for 3D printing. When a piece is printed in nylon using selective laser sintering, it is inexpensive and can be dyed to be bright and eye-catching. A piece in gold, silver or brass is created through a lost-wax casting method. A high-resolution wax model is 3D printed, a plaster mold is formed around it and the wax is replaced by molten metal. Even though metal prints are more expensive than the nylon, they are still affordable because of the size of the models. Be aware that for 3D-printed objects, if you scale a model by a factor of two, that increases the volume of the material (and therefore its cost) by a factor of eight!</p>
<h2 id='mathematical-jewelry-created-in-mathematica'>Mathematical Jewelry Created in Mathematica</h2>
<p>Now that we’ve made some earrings together and explored a number of key functions, I’m excited to share a number of my mathematically inspired pieces of jewelry, all 3D modeled using the Wolfram Language.</p>
<p>3D printing allows for intricate designs that wouldn’t be possible to create in any other way, such as when they consist of interlocking pieces. Some of my all-time bestselling designs are these <a href='https://hanusadesign.com/products/dangling-cubes-earrings-nylon' target=_blank rel=noopener>dangling cubes earrings</a> and the matching <a href='https://hanusadesign.com/products/interlocking-octahedron-necklace-nylon' target=_blank rel=noopener>interlocking octahedron necklace</a>. I aligned the shapes carefully to interlock and optimized their geometry to reduce printing costs.</p>
<p><a href='https://hanusadesign.com/products/dangling-cubes-earrings-nylon' target=_blank rel=noopener><img class='aligncenter' src='https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/39/2021/02/dangling-cube-earrings.png' alt='Dangling cubes earrings' title='Dangling cubes earrings' width='620' height=' '></a></p>
<p class="figure-caption">Image of dangling cubes earrings courtesy of Hanusa Design</p>
<p>This past holiday season, my new <a href='https://hanusadesign.com/products/mobius-necklace-metal' target=_blank rel=noopener>Mobius necklace</a> made a strong impression. Its creation involved making a custom mathematical function for the <a href='https://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=Mobius+strip'>Mobius strip</a> (<tt>ParametricPlot3D</tt> was helpful here) and carefully choosing points on its boundary to make the triangulation aesthetically pleasing.</p>
<p><a href='https://hanusadesign.com/products/mobius-necklace-metal' target=_blank rel=noopener><img class='aligncenter' src='https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/39/2021/02/mobius-necklace.png' alt='Mobius necklace' title='Mobius necklace' width='620' height=' '></a></p>
<p class="figure-caption">Image of Mobius necklace courtesy of Hanusa Design</p>
<p>This <a href='https://hanusadesign.com/products/bubble-pendant-metal' target=_blank rel=noopener>bubble pendant</a> is a piece of <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generative_art' target=_blank rel=noopener>generative art</a>, which means I designed an algorithm to place the rings in random positions and give them random radii but without having specified their final positions. Of course, I made liberal use of the <tt><a href='http://reference.wolfram.com/language/ref/RandomReal.html'>RandomReal</a></tt> function. Read more about the pendant in <a href='https://community.wolfram.com/groups/-/m/t/1270499'>this Wolfram Community post</a>.</p>
<p><a href='https://hanusadesign.com/products/bubble-pendant-metal' target=_blank rel=noopener><img class='aligncenter' src='https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/39/2021/02/bubble-pendant.png' alt='Bubble pendant' title='Bubble pendant' width='620' height=' '></a></p>
<p class="figure-caption">Image of bubble pendant courtesy of Hanusa Design</p>
<p>One of my newer pieces is this collection based on the mathematics of an <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apollonian_gasket#Integral_Apollonian_circle_packings' target=_blank rel=noopener>Apollonian circle packing</a>. Such an arrangement starts out with four circles that all touch each other at one point (the outer circle and three inner circles). The rest of the circles are generated by removing one of the four circles and finding a replacement circle that touches each of the others. This process can continue indefinitely with smaller and smaller circles. The <a href='https://hanusadesign.com/products/bubbly-apollonian-earrings-metal' target=_blank rel=noopener>bubbly Apollonian earrings</a> are a mismatched pair where the initial choice of circles is random. They also have a bubbly feel because the outermost circle was removed. </p>
<p><a href='https://hanusadesign.com/products/bubbly-apollonian-earrings-metal' target=_blank rel=noopener><img class='aligncenter' src='https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/39/2021/02/bubbly-apollonian-earrings.png' alt='Bubbly Apollonian earrings' title='Bubbly Apollonian earrings' width='620' height=' '></a></p>
<p class="figure-caption">Image of bubbly Apollonian earrings courtesy of Hanusa Design</p>
<p>With the <a href='https://hanusadesign.com/products/apollonian-necklace-metal' target=_blank rel=noopener>Apollonian necklace</a>, the wearer&#8217;s neck lies where the largest internal circle would be. The circle replacement procedure was automated in Mathematica and run until all circles larger than a given cutoff were included.</p>
<p><a href='https://hanusadesign.com/products/apollonian-necklace-metal' target=_blank rel=noopener><img class='aligncenter' src='https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/39/2021/02/apollonian-necklace.png' alt='Apollonian necklace' title='Apollonian necklace' width='620' height=' '></a></p>
<p class="figure-caption">Image of Apollonian necklace courtesy of Hanusa Design</p>
<p>Sometimes I hit upon a concept that seems too fun not to make. That was the case with these bold and unique <a href='https://hanusadesign.com/collections/rotini-earrings' target=_blank rel=noopener>rotini earrings</a>, so called because of their <a href='https://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=rotini'>pasta</a>-like shape. These cylindrical earrings were created by rotating the shape of a plus sign (+) around the central axis based on the graph of mathematical functions, such as a <a href='https://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=parabola'>parabola</a>, an <a href='https://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=exponential+function'>exponential function</a> and a <a href='https://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=sawtooth+function'>sawtooth function</a>.</p>
<p><a href='https://hanusadesign.com/collections/rotini-earrings' target=_blank rel=noopener><img class='aligncenter' src='https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/39/2021/02/rotini-earrings.png' alt='Rotini earrings' title='Rotini earrings' width='620' height=' '></a></p>
<p class="figure-caption">Image of rotini earrings courtesy of Hanusa Design</p>
<p>Another source of aesthetic inspiration is the mathematics of <a href='https://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=fractal'>fractals</a>. Their iterative nature is a perfect match to be programmed in Mathematica. Below are my earrings based on the <a href='https://hanusadesign.com/products/koch-tetrahedron-earrings-metal' target=_blank rel=noopener>Koch tetrahedron</a>, a three-dimensional fractal. You start off with a tetrahedron, and on each of the four sides, you build a smaller tetrahedron. This new shape has many more smaller triangular sides, and on each of those, you build an even smaller tetrahedron. I&#8217;ve stopped here for this design, but if you keep going (placing smaller and smaller tetrahedra), you&#8217;ll have the whole fractal, which would be a three-dimensional analog of the <a href='https://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=Koch+snowflake'>Koch snowflake</a>. Surprisingly, the limiting shape of this fractal fits perfectly into a cube.</p>
<p><a href='https://hanusadesign.com/products/koch-tetrahedron-earrings-metal' target=_blank rel=noopener><img class='aligncenter' src='https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/39/2021/02/koch-tetrahedron-earrings.png' alt='Koch tetrahedron earrings' title='Koch tetrahedron earrings' width='620' height=' '></a></p>
<p class="figure-caption">Image of Koch tetrahedron earrings courtesy of Hanusa Design</p>
<p>These <a href='https://hanusadesign.com/products/knights-tour-cube-earrings-nylon' target=_blank rel=noopener>knight&#8217;s tour earrings</a> are some of my personal favorites. I love the black-and-white chess theme that fits the earrings because they are two different knight&#8217;s tours of positions in a 3 &times; 3 &times; 3 cube. I created a <a href='https://reference.wolfram.com/language/ref/KnightTourGraph.html'>knight-move graph</a> in Mathematica and used <tt><a href='http://reference.wolfram.com/language/ref/FindHamiltonianCycle.html'>FindHamiltonianCycle</a></tt> to find two visibly different knight’s tours. I also had to use some trigonometry to stand the cubes on their corners.</p>
<p><a href='https://hanusadesign.com/products/knights-tour-cube-earrings-nylon' target=_blank rel=noopener><img class='aligncenter' src='https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/39/2021/02/knights-tour-earrings.png' alt='Knight’s tour earrings' title='Knight’s tour earrings' width='533' height=' '></a></p>
<p class="figure-caption">Image of knight’s tour earrings courtesy of Hanusa Design</p>
<p>Some of my earliest pieces are these statement pendants based on the always visually pleasing <a href='https://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=Voronoi+diagram'>Voronoi diagrams</a> (available through the <tt><a href='http://reference.wolfram.com/language/ref/VoronoiMesh.html'>VoronoiMesh</a></tt> function). The <a href='https://hanusadesign.com/products/honeycomb-pendant-steel' target=_blank rel=noopener>honeycomb pendant</a> required intersecting the Voronoi diagram with other shapes. (<tt><a href='http://reference.wolfram.com/language/ref/RegionIntersection.html'>RegionIntersection</a></tt> was useful here.) </p>
<p><a href='https://hanusadesign.com/products/honeycomb-pendant-steel' target=_blank rel=noopener><img class='aligncenter' src='https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/39/2021/02/honeycomb-pendant.png' alt='Honeycomb pendant' title='Honeycomb pendant' width='530' height=' '></a></p>
<p class="figure-caption">Image of honeycomb pendant courtesy of Hanusa Design</p>
<p>The points defining the Voronoi diagram in the <a href='https://hanusadesign.com/products/fibonacci-snowflake-pendant-steel' target=_blank rel=noopener>Fibonacci snowflake pendant</a> lie along a <a href='https://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=Fibonacci+spiral'>Fibonacci spiral</a>.</p>

<p class="figure-caption">Image of Fibonacci snowflake pendant courtesy of Hanusa Design</p>
<p>I&#8217;ll end this photo tour with a design that I can stare at for hours: my <a href='https://hanusadesign.com/products/introspection-necklace-metal' target=_blank rel=noopener>introspection necklace</a>. This pendant is inspired by the fourth dimension; if you look carefully, you can see that it was constructed by combining two <a href='https://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=hypercube'>hypercubes</a>. I have found that 3D design requires thinking about the layers that are visible and what parts of a design block other parts of the design. The ability to partially see through an object makes for a more intricate and captivating item. </p>

<p>Math is one of the main things that deters students from wanting to learn more about <a href='https://www.wolframalpha.com/examples/science-and-technology/chemistry/'>chemistry</a>. Being a chemical engineering student, I understand this, especially for students who just have to get chemistry out of the way as a general education requirement. Essentially, <a href='https://www.wolframalpha.com/examples/pro-features/step-by-step-solutions/'>step-by-step solutions</a> are like your own on-demand math tutor: in addition to calculating the answer, <a href='https://www.wolframalpha.com'>Wolfram|Alpha</a> shows you how it got there. Here are six important math skills that you will definitely use on a regular basis in your chemistry class and how they relate to different chemistry concepts.<span id="more-71869"></span></p>
<h2 id='1.-basic-algebra'>1. Basic Algebra</h2>
<p>A lot of chemistry skills involve the application of basic algebra. However, most of the algebra is hidden behind fancy chemistry words like “reactants,” “products,” “moles,” “molarity” and so on. If you read these problems closely enough, you will see that most of the work is really just an algebra problem.</p>
<p>First off, let’s look at an expression to brush up on algebra skills that may appear in equilibrium constant, <span class='InlineFormula'><img src="https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/39/2021/02/rs212-img1.png" width= '18' height='21' align='absmiddle'></span> problems. Simplify the following expression: (<em>x</em> + 1) &ndash; 2(<em>x</em><sup>2</sup> + 10 * <em>x</em>). This is done by distributing the negative coefficient to all parts in the parentheses, combining like terms and  ordering terms from the highest exponent to the the lowest exponent. In Wolfram|Alpha, if you type “<a href='https://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=simplify+%28x+%2B+1%29+-+2%28x%5E2+%2B+10*x%29'>simplify (x + 1) &#8211; 2 (x^2 + 10 * x)</a>”, you can find the step-by-step solution for this:</p>
<p><a href='https://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=simplify+%28x+%2B+1%29+-+2%28x%5E2+%2B+10*x%29'><img class='aligncenter' src='https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/39/2021/02/rs212img01.png' alt='Step-by-step solution' title='Step-by-step solution' width='620' height=' '/></a></p>
<p><a href='https://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=fractions'>Fractions</a> are another thing that you will see a lot in chemistry, particularly in stoichiometry problems. Let’s take a look at a basic example of multiplying and dividing fractions. What is the solution for <a href='https://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=4%2F3*2%2F3'>4/3 * 2/3</a>? Wolfram|Alpha provides a comprehensive step-by-step solution as a refresher on how to multiply fractions:</p>
<p><a href='https://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=4%2F3*2%2F3'><img class='aligncenter' src='https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/39/2021/02/rs212img02.png' alt='Step-by-step solution' title='Step-by-step solution' width='620' height=' '/></a></p>
<p>Next, let’s look at a chemistry problem that uses fractions. This may be something that doesn’t look familiar to you now, but it soon will! Consider the chemical reaction <a href='https://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=AlCl3+%2B+NaOH+-%3E+Al%28OH%293+%2B+NaCl'>AlCl3 + NaOH -> Al(OH)3 + NaCl</a>. Assuming you have <a href='https://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=2+moles+of+AlCl3'>two moles of AlCl3</a>, how many moles of <a href='https://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=NaCl'>NaCl</a> can you make by running the reaction to completion? Well, you can type “<a href='https://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=+2+mole+AlCl3+%2B+NaOH+-%3E+Al%28OH%293+%2B+NaCl'>2 mole AlCl3 + NaOH -> Al(OH)3 + NaCl</a>” into Wolfram|Alpha:</p>
<p><a href='https://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=+2+mole+AlCl3+%2B+NaOH+-%3E+Al%28OH%293+%2B+NaCl'><img class='aligncenter' src='https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/39/2021/02/rs212img03.png' alt='Step-by-step solution' title='Step-by-step solution' width='620' height=' '/></a></p>
<p>Looking at the stoichiometry step-by-step results, we can see that the answer would be six moles of NaCl. Looking at step 4, your equation dwindles down to <span class='InlineFormula'><img src="https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/39/2021/02/rs212-img3.png" width= '85' height='39' align='absmiddle'></span> * <span class='InlineFormula'><img src="https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/39/2021/02/rs212-img4.png" width= '83' height='40' align='absmiddle'></span> = 6 moles of NaCl. Not as bad as it looks at first, right?</p>
<h2 id='2.-unit-conversions'>2. Unit Conversions</h2>
<p>Every chemistry student’s worst nightmare: <a href='https://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=unit+conversion+examples'>unit conversions</a>, such as converting from centimeters to meters, <a href='https://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=mL'>milliliters</a> to <a href='https://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=liters'>liters</a> and so on. But if you think about it, they’re  just fractions, which we covered in the previous section. It is one of the most common things for students to get wrong on their first chemistry exam, usually by multiplying instead of dividing or vice versa. On top of that, most units in chemistry are in metric, also known as <a href='https://www.wolframalpha.com/examples/science-and-technology/units-and-measures/units/si-units/'>SI</a>, units, which may be unfamiliar to those living in the US. </p>
<p>Let’s start with a more familiar unit: gallons. Let’s convert one gallon of water to liters. By typing “<a href='https://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=convert+1+gallon+of+water+to+liters'>convert 1 gallon of water to liters</a>”, we see that it is equal to 3.785 liters. Using this knowledge, if you had two gallons, you could multiply 3.785 by 2 to get 7.571 liters:</p>
<p><a href='https://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=convert+1+gallon+of+water+to+liters'><img class='aligncenter' src='https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/39/2021/02/rs212img04.png' alt='Step-by-step solution' title='Step-by-step solution' width='620' height=' '/></a></p>
<p>Let’s look at a common chemistry conversion: converting mass to moles. This is one of many <a href='https://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=dimensional+analysis'>dimensional analysis</a> problems you will encounter in chemistry. You’ve just measured out 10 g of sucrose on the laboratory balance but need to know how many moles of sucrose you have. You can do this conversion by entering “<a href='https://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=10+grams+of+sucrose+to+moles+'>10 grams of sucrose to moles</a>” into Wolfram|Alpha:</p>
<p><a href='https://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=10+grams+of+sucrose+to+moles+'><img class='aligncenter' src='https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/39/2021/02/rs212img05.png' alt='Step-by-step solution' title='Step-by-step solution' width='620' height=' '/></a></p>
<h2 id='3.-finding-the-slope-and-intercept-of-a-line-'>3. Finding the Slope and Intercept of a Line </h2>
<p>Chemists are especially fond of linear relationship, with a very popular one being the basis of <a href='https://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=Beer%E2%80%90Lambert+law'>Beer&ndash;Lambert law</a> experiments. Using data collected from a spectrophotometer for samples of known concentration, a line of best fit can be formed, which is also called a <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear_regression' target=_blank rel=noopener>linear regression</a>. The form that this equation takes is <em><a href='https://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=y%3D+mx+%2Bb'>y = mx + b</a></em>, where <em>m</em> is the <a href='https://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=slope'>slope</a> and <em>b</em> is the <em><a href='https://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=y+intercept'>y</em> intercept</a>. </p>
<p>By taking a simple equation like <em><a href='https://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=y+%3D+3x+%2B+1'>y</em> = 3<em>x</em> + 1</a>, identifying what the slope and intercept are will be helpful as these values can be plugged into other equations or interpreted to determine specific trends or correlations. For example, if the slope is negative, that means there is an inverse correlation, versus a positive slope having a direct correlation.</p>
<p>Given a list of points {{1, 2}, {2, 3}, {3, 5}, {4, 6}}, Wolfram|Alpha can determine the best-fitting linear equation: “<a href='https://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=linear+equation+%7B%7B1%2C+2%7D%2C+%7B2%2C+3%7D%2C+%7B3%2C+5%7D%2C+%7B4%2C+6%7D%7D'>linear equation {{1, 2}, {2, 3}, {3, 5}, {4, 6}}</a>”:</p>
<p><a href='https://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=linear+equation+%7B%7B1%2C+2%7D%2C+%7B2%2C+3%7D%2C+%7B3%2C+5%7D%2C+%7B4%2C+6%7D%7D'><img class='aligncenter' src='https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/39/2021/02/rs212img06.png' alt='Step-by-step solution' title='Step-by-step solution' width='620' height=' '/></a></p>
<p>Additionally, Wolfram|Alpha can be used to rewrite an equation that is not in <em>y</em> = <em>mx</em> + <em>b</em> form to turn it into this form. For example, given the equation <a href='https://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=2x+%2B+7y+-+5+%3D+0'>2<em>x</em> + 7<em>y</em> &ndash; 5 = 0</a>, what is the slope and intercept? Just enter “<a href='https://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=solve+2x%2B7y-5%3D0+for+y'>solve 2x + 7y &#8211; 5 = 0 for y</a>”:</p>
<p><a href='https://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=solve+2x%2B7y-5%3D0+for+y'><img class='aligncenter' src='https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/39/2021/02/rs212img07.png' alt='Step-by-step solution' title='Step-by-step solution' width='620' height=' '/></a></p>
<p>The slope would be <em>m</em> = –2/7, and the <em>y</em> intercept is <em>b</em> = 5/7. You can also type in “<a href='https://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=slope+and+y+intercept+of+2x%2B7y-5%3D0'>slope and y intercept of 2x + 7y &#8211; 5 = 0</a>” and receive the answers directly, but it’s helpful to know how to identify each part in the slope-intercept form of the equation. Following this, if someone were to ask what the value of <em>y</em> is given that <em>x</em> = 5, by evaluating <a href='https://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=-2%2F7x+%2B+5%2F7+at+x%3D5'>–2/7<em>x</em> + 5/7 at <em>x</em> = 5</a>, the answer would be –5/7, which can be calculated using the basic algebra skills seen previously:</p>
<p><a href='https://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=-2%2F7x+%2B+5%2F7+at+x%3D5'><img class='aligncenter' src='https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/39/2021/02/rs212img08.png' alt='Step-by-step solution' title='Step-by-step solution' width='620' height=' '/></a></p>
<p>Being able to identify what the slope and <em>y</em> intercept are, and also plugging in values to determine what <em>y</em> is, is a very important skill for topics in chemistry, such as kinetics.</p>
<p>In chemistry, we use Celsius to measure temperature instead of Fahrenheit. Given a couple known temperatures in Celsius and Fahrenheit, how can we convert other temperatures without using a digital assistant? Well, let’s take five points, where the pairings will be listed as {Fahrenheit, Celsius}: {{40, 4.4}, {50, 10}, {60, 15}, {70, 21}, {80, 26}}. We can find the information for this line with “<a href='https://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=linear+regression+%7B%7B40+%2C+4.4%7D%2C+%7B50+%2C+10+%7D%2C+%7B60+%2C+15%7D%2C+%7B70+%2C+21%7D%2C+%7B80+%2C+26%7D%7D'>linear regression {{40, 4.4}, {50, 10}, {60, 15}, {70, 21}, {80, 26}}</a>”:</p>
<p><a href='https://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=linear+regression+%7B%7B40+%2C+4.4%7D%2C+%7B50+%2C+10+%7D%2C+%7B60+%2C+15%7D%2C+%7B70+%2C+21%7D%2C+%7B80+%2C+26%7D%7D'><img class='aligncenter' src='https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/39/2021/02/rs212img09.png' alt='Step-by-step solution' title='Step-by-step solution' width='620' height=' '/></a></p>
<p>The equation of this line is <em>y</em> = 0.542<em>x</em> – 17.24, with <em>x</em> being Fahrenheit and <em>y</em> being Celsius. So if you have a value in Celsius or Fahrenheit, you can convert to either one by plugging the value into this equation and solving for the other variable. So if you’re trying to convert from Fahrenheit to Celsius, of course just typing in “<a href='https://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=75+F+to+C'>75 F to C</a>” will do the trick, but being able to see this linear correlation can help you determine this conversion even if you don’t have access to the internet.</p>
<h2 id='4.-solving-for-x'>4. Solving for x</h2>
<p>Another important concept needed to succeed in your first chemistry class is how to solve for <em>x</em> using inverse operations. Rearranging numbers and variables around to isolate <em>x</em> and determining the unknown value are so important in solving for different values, such as energy, mass, volume and so on. </p>
<p>Let&#8217;s take an example using multiplication and division to solve for <em>x</em>. Given the equation 8 * <em>x </em>= 3 * 0.08206 * 298, what is the value of <em>x</em>? This is actually an equation taken straight from the <a href='https://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=ideal+gas+law'>ideal gas law</a> with numeric values plugged in. Ideal gas law problems allow us to solve for pressure, volume, amount of substance and temperature.  In all cases, the effort distills down to an expression with x in it to be solved for. After combining terms, Wolfram|Alpha solves this via &#8220;<a href='https://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=solve+8+*+x+%3D+3+*+0.08206+*+298+for+x'>solve 8 * x = 3 * 0.08206 * 298 for x</a>”:</p>
<p><a href='https://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=solve+8+*+x+%3D+3+*+0.08206+*+298+for+x'><img class='aligncenter' src='https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/39/2021/02/rs212img010.png' alt='Step-by-step solution' title='Step-by-step solution' width='620' height=' '/></a></p>
<p>We could include results from the <a href='https://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=ideal+gas+law+calculator+n%3D1+mole%2C+T%3D150K%2C+P%3D1atm'>ideal gas law calculator</a> for an example problem. Determine the volume of 1 mole of methane gas at 150 Kelvin and 1 atm:</p>
<p><a href='https://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=ideal+gas+law+calculator+n%3D1+mole%2C+T%3D150K%2C+P%3D1atm'><img class='aligncenter' src='https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/39/2021/02/rs212img011.png' alt='Step-by-step solution' title='Step-by-step solution' width='620' height=' '/></a></p>
<p>Here is another problem that uses exponent rules: “<a href='https://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=solve+for+x+when+10%5E2+%3D+200%2Fsqrt%28x%29'>solve for x when 10^2 = 200/sqrt(x)</a>”. After simplifying 10<sup>2</sup> to 100, the rest of the steps are shown, which gives a good refresher for using exponents to isolate variables:</p>
<p><a href='https://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=solve+for+x+when+10%5E2+%3D+200%2Fsqrt%28x%29'><img class='aligncenter' src='https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/39/2021/02/rs212img012.png' alt='Step-by-step solution' title='Step-by-step solution' width='620' height=' '/></a></p>
<p>Let’s take a look at a more complicated example. This one involves solving for <em>x</em> in a quadratic function, which appears in <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_equilibrium' target=_blank rel=noopener>equilibrium</a> and <a href='https://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=buffers'>buffer</a> problems. Given that 0.0125 = (<em>x</em>)*(<em>x</em> + 0.1) / (3 – <em>x</em>), what is <em>x</em>? This one is much more difficult to do by hand, so let’s look at what Wolfram|Alpha has to say for “<a href='https://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=solve+0.0125+%3D+%28x%29*%28x+%2B+0.1%29+%2F+%283+-x%29'>solve 0.0125 = (x)*(x + 0.1) / (3 &#8211; x)</a>”:</p>
<p><a href='https://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=solve+0.0125+%3D+%28x%29*%28x+%2B+0.1%29+%2F+%283+-x%29'><img class='aligncenter' src='https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/39/2021/02/rs212img013.png' alt='Step-by-step solution' title='Step-by-step solution' width='620' height=' '/></a></p>
<p>There is a step-by-step solution available for this problem as well, but the two answers after clicking the <span class="computer-voice">Approximate form</span> button are <em>x</em> = –0.25790 and <em>x </em>= 0.14540. This is very useful in chemistry, especially when solving equilibrium reactions. However, you will encounter solving for <em>x</em> anywhere in chemistry that involves an equation.</p>
<h2 id='5.-logarithms'>5. Logarithms</h2>
<p>For the most part, logarithms are computed using calculators when solving acid-base problems, but it is helpful to know how to use them. In chemistry, the main types of logarithms that are used are base 10 and base <em>e</em>, or the natural log (the <span class="computer-voice">ln</span> button on your calculator). Unless the logarithm is equal to a whole number, you would probably have to use a calculator to solve these. An important concept to know about logarithms is how to switch back and forth from the exponential form to the logarithmic form. For example, what is the exponential form of log10(100) = 2? It would be 10<sup>2</sup> = 100. Given this example, you should be able to determine the value of a variable given a logarithm problem. For example, what is the value of <em>x</em> in <a href='https://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=solve+log10%28x%29+%3D+4'>log10(<em>x</em>) = 4</a>? Wolfram|Alpha has a great step-by-step solution for this:</p>
<p><a href='https://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=solve+log10%28x%29+%3D+4'><img class='aligncenter' src='https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/39/2021/02/rs212img014.png' alt='Step-by-step solution' title='Step-by-step solution' width='620' height=' '/></a></p>
<p>Logarithms are mainly used in pH calculations, since pH is measured on a base-10 scale, meaning that a pH of 3 is 10 times “stronger” than a pH of 4. That being said, many times you would end up with a pH that is not a whole number. You can also use Wolfram|Alpha to calculate logarithms that would be harder to compute by hand, such as the value of <em>x</em> in the equation log10(<em>x</em>) = 3.5. “<a href='https://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=solve+log10%28x%29+%3D3.5'>Solve log10(x) = 3.5</a>” generates an answer of 3162.3, as seen here after clicking the <span class="computer-voice">Decimal form</span> button:</p>
<p><a href='https://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=solve+log10%28x%29+%3D3.5'><img class='aligncenter' src='https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/39/2021/02/rs212img015.png' alt='Step-by-step solution' title='Step-by-step solution' width='620' height=' '/></a></p>
<p>The process for solving this problem is similar to the previous one, but it is very hard to calculate a decimal exponent, so using a computer or calculator to determine this answer is necessary. It also is worth mentioning that log(<em>x</em>) in Wolfram|Alpha is not interpreted as base 10, but as the natural log. If you need base 10, make sure to type log10(<em>x</em>).</p>
<h2 id='6.-finding-the-roots-of-a-quadratic-equation'>6. Finding the Roots of a Quadratic Equation</h2>
<p>The last important concept to know for your first chemistry course is finding roots of quadratic equations. A quadratic equation has the form <em>a</em> * <em>x</em><sup>2</sup> + <em>b</em> * <em>x</em> + <em>c</em> = 0 with the values of<em> x</em> given by –<em>b</em> ± Sqrt[<em>b</em><sup>2</sup> – 4<em>ac</em>]/2<em>a</em>, which is known as the <a href='https://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=quadratic+formula&#038;assumption=%7B%22F%22%2C+%22QuadraticEquation%22%2C+%22c%22%7D+-%3E%221%22&#038;assumption=%7B%22FS%22%7D+-%3E+%7B%7B%22QuadraticEquation%22%2C+%22x%22%7D%7D&#038;assumption=%7B%22F%22%2C+%22QuadraticEquation%22%2C+%22b%22%7D+-%3E%22-2%22&#038;assumption=%7B%22F%22%2C+%22QuadraticEquation%22%2C+%22a%22%7D+-%3E%221%22&#038;assumption=%7B%22C%22%2C+%22quadratic+formula%22%7D+-%3E+%7B%22MathWorld%22%7D'>quadratic formula</a>. Of course, solving for roots like this often trips people up, but using the computer to solve it for you is much quicker and exact! In the world of chemistry, solving for the roots of a quadratic function is useful when solving equilibrium problems, particularly <span class='InlineFormula'><img src="https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/39/2021/02/rs212-img7.png" width= '19' height='25' align='absmiddle'></span> equations, where there is no denominator like there usually is.</p>
<p>Consider the <span class='InlineFormula'><img src="https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/39/2021/02/rs212-img8.png" width= '19' height='25' align='absmiddle'></span> problem where you need to solve for the roots for the equation <em><a href='https://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=x*%280.001+%2B+x%29+%3D+1.5+*+10%5E-5+'>x</em> * (0.001 + <em>x</em>) = 1.5 * 10<sup>–5</sup></a>. This would be a case where the terms have to be rearranged first so that the equation is equal to 0 before using the quadratic formula. There is a detailed step-by-step solution for this problem:</p>
<p><a href='https://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=x*%280.001+%2B+x%29+%3D+1.5+*+10%5E-5+'><img class='aligncenter' src='https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/39/2021/02/rs212img016.png' alt='Step-by-step solution' title='Step-by-step solution' width='620' height=' '/></a></p>
<p>Sometimes equations containing cubic terms, like <em>x</em><sup>3</sup>, and higher may appear in your homework problems. An example of this is <em>x</em><sup>3</sup> &ndash; <em>x</em><sup>2</sup> + 9 * <em>x</em> &ndash; 9 = 0. What are the values of <em>x</em> in this case? Wolfram|Alpha will kindly determine the roots with the input “<a href='https://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=solve+x%5E3+-+x%5E2+%2B+9*x+-+9+%3D+0'>solve x^3 &#8211; x^2 + 9 * x &#8211; 9 = 0</a>”:</p>
<p><a href='https://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=solve+x%5E3+-+x%5E2+%2B+9*x+-+9+%3D+0'><img class='aligncenter' src='https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/39/2021/02/rs212img017.png' alt='Step-by-step solution' title='Step-by-step solution' width='620' height=' '/></a></p>
<p>Keep in mind that there are more ways to solve for the roots of an equation than the quadratic formula. Wolfram|Alpha provides different types of step-by-step solutions that can teach you to solve the same equations by hand, whether it be factor method, quadratic formula or completing the square.</p>
<h2 id='math-and-chemistry-go-hand-in-hand'>Math and Chemistry Go Hand in Hand</h2>
<p>As you learn more about chemistry concepts, you can see how intertwined the math is with chemistry. It really is beautiful how it all comes together in the end, but it’s important to be comfortable with the algebra behind it in order to be able to see the connectedness. I recommend using Wolfram|Alpha Pro for solving both <a href='https://www.wolframalpha.com/examples/pro-features/step-by-step-solutions/'>math</a> and <a href='https://www.wolframalpha.com/examples/pro-features/step-by-step-solutions/step-by-step-chemistry/'>chemistry</a> problems, since many of the problems will give you the step-by-step solutions for solving them, which can help you have much success in your chemistry classes!</p>

<p>Over a thousand new individual <a href='https://www.wolfram.com/wolfram-u/certification/'>Wolfram Certifications</a> were awarded in 2020 since the launch of new and updated online interactive courses and <a href='https://www.wolfram.com/wolfram-u/special-event/study-groups/'>Daily Study Groups</a> from <a href='https://www.wolfram.com/wolfram-u/'>Wolfram U</a>. Students and professionals around the world have developed their skills and demonstrated proficiency in <a href='https://www.wolfram.com/technologies/?source=nav'>Wolfram technologies</a>, as well as several topic-specific applications. We&#8217;re excited to now offer expanded achievement opportunities for certification in more areas and more levels.<span id="more-71814"></span></p>
<h2 id='why-is-certification-important?'>Why Is Certification Important?</h2>
<p>Wolfram certification provides an easy way to demonstrate your proficiency in using Wolfram technologies or with subject areas such as image processing, data science and calculus, with many more areas to come. </p>
<p>If you’re preparing for college, a promotion or an entirely new career, there’s likely a certification that will help bolster your credentials. With global questions about the future of standardized tests and the ability to “prove” learned skills, certifications are a great way to communicate proficiencies.  </p>
<h2 id='what-levels-of-certification-are-available?'>What Levels of Certification Are Available?</h2>
<p>Our Wolfram U courses and programs offer different paths to certification to meet your needs. The most popular level of certification is one of <b>course completion</b> or <b>program completion</b>, which shows that an individual has completed a particular course of study. Course completion can be earned with many of our <a href='https://www.wolfram.com/wolfram-u/all-classes-courses/?tab=interactive-courses'>Wolfram U interactive courses</a> by watching the lesson videos and passing auto-graded quizzes on your topic of study. This type of course completion certification is available now for courses such as <a href='https://www.wolfram.com/wolfram-u/introduction-to-notebooks/'>Introduction to Notebooks</a>, <a href='https://www.wolfram.com/wolfram-u/introduction-to-calculus/'>Introduction to Calculus</a> and <a href='https://www.wolfram.com/wolfram-u/introduction-to-image-processing/'>Introduction to Image Processing</a>.</p>
<p><img class='aligncenter' src='https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/39/2021/02/img0011.png' alt='Wolfram U interactive courses' title='Wolfram U interactive courses' width='620' height=' '/></p>
<p>The program completion certification has been a popular achievement for <a href='https://www.wolfram.com/wolfram-u/special-event/study-groups/'>Wolfram Daily Study Groups</a>, which we debuted in April 2020. Each study group focuses on a specific topic area and meets daily over the course of one or more weeks. Study Groups rely on weekly cloud-deployed quizzes for assessment. </p>
<p>Of the thousands who have attended Daily Study Groups, an impressive 24% have earned program completion certificates in areas such as Wolfram Language programming fundamentals, machine learning basics, linear algebra and analyzing COVID-19 data. The extended, more comprehensive Study Groups also reward those who successfully complete exercises with <a href='https://www.wolfram.com/wolfram-u/certification/level1/language/'>Wolfram Technology Certified Level 1 in the Wolfram Language</a>, a proficiency certification that is available to anyone (attendee or not) who passes the certification exam.</p>
<p><img class='aligncenter' src='https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/39/2021/02/img0021.png' alt='Wolfram Daily Study Groups' title='Wolfram Daily Study Groups' width='620' height=' '/></p>
<p>Additional <b>Level 1 Certifications</b> are now offered with some of our interactive courses as well. To earn Wolfram Level 1 Certification for proficiency in calculus or linear algebra, you must pass a final exam in addition to watching the video lessons and passing the quizzes (similar to the requirements for a traditional mathematics course). To earn Wolfram Level 1 Certification for proficiency in image processing or multiparadigm data science, you are required to complete auto-graded exercise sets. Tracking your certification progress is easy and convenient—just click the certification icon from the course navigation bar. You can download or print your personalized certificate there too.</p>
<p><img class='aligncenter' src='https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/39/2021/02/img0031.png' alt='Wolfram Level 1 Certification' title='Wolfram Level 1 Certification' width='620' height=' '/></p>
<h2 id='what-about-level-2-certification?'>What about Level 2 Certification?</h2>
<p>Wolfram <b>Level 2 Certification</b> requires submitting an independent project that demonstrates expertise in the subject area. Submissions are assessed according to a grading rubric. <a href='https://www.wolfram.com/wolfram-u/certification/level2/multiparadigm-data-science/'>Multiparadigm Data Science Level 2 Certification</a> is now available and completes a fully developed certification path for those interested in the field. For a guided pathway to this certification, you can attend the <a href='https://www.wolfram.com/wolfram-u/special-event/data-science-boot-camp/'>Wolfram Data Science Boot Camp</a>, which takes place July 19&ndash;30 this year. You can find out more and check out some of last year&#8217;s projects in <a href='https://blog.wolfram.com/2020/09/24/unlocking-next-level-certification-at-the-wolfram-data-science-boot-camp/'>this blog post</a>.</p>
<p><img class='aligncenter' src='https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/39/2021/02/img0041.png' alt='Multiparadigm Data Science interactive course' title='Multiparadigm Data Science interactive course' width='620' height=' '/></p>
<p>With the <a href='https://www.wolfram.com/wolfram-u/multiparadigm-data-science/'>Multiparadigm Data Science</a> interactive course, you can immerse yourself in lesson videos and notebooks, practicing your work in the scratch notebook that runs in the <a href='https://www.wolframcloud.com/'>Wolfram Cloud</a>. As you complete the video lessons and take the section quizzes, track your progress for course completion along the way. </p>
<p>You might choose to also work toward your Level 1 Certification by working on exercises as you move through the course. The progress tracker makes it easy to return to sections you’ve skipped or need to try again. It’s OK to go back and correct your errors in the exercises or quizzes to earn a higher score. After achieving course completion and Level 1 Certification, you are ready to consider Level 2. Although advanced certifications are fee-based, the interactive courses are all free, including your course completion certification.</p>

<p>Sound classification can be a hard task, especially when sound samples have small variations that can be imperceptible to the human ear. The use of machines, and recently machine learning models, has been shown to be an effective approach to solving the problem of classifying sounds. These applications can help improve diagnoses and have been a topic of research in areas such as <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cardiology' target=_blank rel=noopener>cardiology</a> and <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pulmonology' target=_blank rel=noopener>pulmonology</a>. Recent innovations such as a <a href='https://www.researchsquare.com/article/rs-63796/v1' target=_blank rel=noopener>convolutional neural network identifying COVID-19 coughs</a> and the <a href='https://news.mit.edu/2020/covid-19-cough-cellphone-detection-1029' target=_blank rel=noopener>MIT AI model detecting asymptomatic COVID-19 infections using cough recordings</a> show some promising results for identifying COVID-19 patients just by the sound of their coughs. Looking at these references, this task may look quite challenging and like something that can be done only by top-notch researchers. In this post, we will discuss how you can get very promising results using the machine learning and audio functionalities in the <a href='https://www.wolfram.com/language/'>Wolfram Language</a>.<span id="more-71789"></span></p>
<p>Using a labeled COVID-19 open-source <a href='https://github.com/virufy/virufy_data' target=_blank rel=noopener>cough-sound dataset</a>, we construct a recurrent neural network and feed in preprocessed audio signals using <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mel-frequency_cepstrum#:~:text=Mel%2Dfrequency%20cepstral%20coefficients%20(MFCCs,%2Da%2Dspectrum%22).' target=_blank rel=noopener>Mel-frequency cepstral coefficient</a> (MFCC) feature extraction. This approach gave us an accuracy of around 96%, which is similar to the results obtained in different published studies, even when our data was limited to only 121 samples.</p>
<p>The data we used consists of 121 segmented samples of cough sounds in .mp3 format, which are publicly available <a href='https://github.com/virufy/virufy_data' target=_blank rel=noopener>here</a>. This data has two classes: 48 samples from patients who tested positive for COVID-19 and 73 samples from patients who tested negative for COVID-19:</p>

<p>Audio encoding is an important step for audio classification, as any sound generated by humans is determined by the shape of their vocal tracts (including tongue, teeth, etc.). If this shape can be determined correctly, any sound produced can be accurately represented. The same happens with musical instruments: even when two different instruments can generate the same sound frequency, they will sound different because of the physical characteristics of the instrument (piano, guitar, flute, etc.). The envelope of the time power spectrum of the speech signal is representative of the vocal tract, which MFCCs accurately represent. Some diseases, such as a pulmonary disease, can affect the way the air travels through our respiratory system, so it may cause a difference in sound between a healthy patient and a sick patient:</p>

<p>MFCCs were first introduced to characterize the seismic echoes that result from earthquakes. In order to obtain MFCCs, we first apply the <a href='https://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=Fourier+Transform'>Fourier transform</a> over the original sound wave on the time domain, then apply the logarithm of the magnitude over the resulting spectrum, and finally apply a cosine transformation. This resulting spectrum, called the cepstrum in the quefrency domain, is neither in the frequency domain nor in the time domain.</p>

<p>We can see how the audio has been converted into a matrix that represents the cepstral features of the audio. This will be the input for our model. We will build a custom recurrent neural network (RNN), for which hyperparameters have been tuned by hand, iterating them on a tune-train-evaluate process. That means the RNN will: (1) choose a set of hyperparameters; (2) train the model; (3) evaluate the model; and (4) repeat steps one through three. We repeat this process until the model shows low overfitting and high evaluation metrics. The result is the following RNN:</p>

<p>After the training, we will make an evaluation of the model, applying it to the previously unseen test data and measuring its performance. For that, we will try different metrics:</p>
<ul>
<li>Accuracy: the ratio of correctly predicted observations to the total observations.</li>
<li>F1 score: the weighted average of precision and recall.</li>
<li>Precision and recall: precision is the ratio of correctly predicted positive observations to the total predicted positive observations, while recall is the ratio of correctly predicted positive observations to all observations in the actual class (see an example in the following image).</li>
<li>Confusion matrix plot: allows us to see the true positive, true negative, false positive and false negative predicted values.</li>
<li>ROC curve: tells us how capably the model can accurately distinguish between classes (see next figure). The bigger the overlap between negative class and positive class curves, the poorer the ROC curve will be. An optimal ROC curve will be the one with an area under the curve (AUC) equal to 1.</li>

<p>Overall, we have obtained a great performance with the metrics we have evaluated. They tell us that the model has the capacity to correctly identify or discard the presence of COVID-19 disease from patients’ cough sounds. </p>
<p>We have constructed a model that has the ability to detect COVID-19 by classifying cough sounds with around 96% accuracy. This shows not only the power of recurrent neural networks to solve sound classification tasks, but also the potential for solving medical tasks such as diagnosing pulmonary disease. We were able to reproduce the results published by the <a href='https://news.mit.edu/2020/covid-19-cough-cellphone-detection-1029' target=_blank rel=noopener>MIT team</a> and the <a href='https://www.researchsquare.com/article/rs-63796/v1' target=_blank rel=noopener>Manchester team</a>. Our dataset was small (121 samples), but the results are promising and open the possibility of future research.</p>

<p><a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/System_dynamics' target=_blank rel=noopener>System dynamics</a> (SD) is a very powerful and flexible modeling paradigm, ideally suited to tackle strategic business, economics and public policy issues. Some years ago, <a href='https://community.wolfram.com/web/gwr'>Guido Wolf Reichert</a>, management consultant and developer for <a href='https://bsl-support.de/?lang=en' target=_blank rel=noopener>BSL Management Support</a>, Germany, stumbled into problems while modeling the public transport system in a German metropolis. He had reached the technical limits of the established SD software. While looking for alternatives, he discovered <a href='https://www.wolfram.com/system-modeler/'>Wolfram System Modeler</a>.</p>
<p><img class='aligncenter' src='https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/39/2021/02/business-simulation-library.png' alt='System Dynamics Modeling—Now Available with the Business Simulation Library' title='System Dynamics Modeling—Now Available with the Business Simulation Library' width='505' height=' '/><span id="more-71679"></span></p>
<h2 id='developing-the-business-simulation-library'>Developing the Business Simulation Library</h2>
<p>In this blog, the developer will explain his motivation for creating the <a href='https://www.wolfram.com/system-modeler/libraries/business-simulation/'>Business Simulation library</a> (BSL) and how the library makes it easy, convenient and fast to model dynamical systems in business, ecology and social sciences in general without any need to write equations. The library is available for download for free at the <a href='https://www.wolfram.com/system-modeler/libraries/business-simulation/'>System Modeler library store</a>.</p>
<h3>Q: Tell us a bit about yourself. Why did you develop the library?</h3>
<p>A: I am a management consultant employing computer simulation to help clients make better decisions by better understanding the complexity of the system under management. In my work, I am mainly using system dynamics, a modeling methodology developed by <a href='https://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=Jay+W.+Forrester'>Jay W. Forrester</a> in the 1960s.</p>
<p>Some years ago during a rather challenging project to model the public transport system in a German metropolis, I needed to expand my toolset, as the established system dynamics software I was using reached its technical limits. At that time I discovered <a href='https://www.wolfram.com/mathematica/'>Wolfram Mathematica</a> and became instantly hooked. In that project, I then used Mathematica mainly for modeling data and for testing, while the system modeling itself was done in Java by a programmer, who used my system dynamics model diagrams and translated them.</p>
<p>Later, when I had become a rather savvy programmer in the <a href='https://www.wolfram.com/language/'>Wolfram Language</a> myself, I started to use Mathematica to run external system dynamics models and to code differential equations in Mathematica directly. But one needs a GUI to model systems, which is how I became aware of Wolfram System Modeler and its <a href='https://www.wolfram.com/system-modeler/libraries/system-dynamics/'>SystemDynamics</a> library from reading Mikael Forsgren’s <a href='https://blog.wolfram.com/2013/06/11/energy-resource-dynamics-with-the-new-system-dynamics-library-for-systemmodeler/'>Wolfram Blog post</a>. But, I have to be very honest here, the SystemDynamics library it announced did not convince me—and so I let matters rest a bit.</p>
<p>Some years later, having stumbled upon <a href='https://www.modelica.org/modelicalanguage' target=_blank rel=noopener>Modelica</a> models by <a href='https://www.modelica.org/news_items/tiller_book' target=_blank rel=noopener>Michael Tiller</a> and <a href='http://www.peter-junglas.de/fh/simulation/systemdynamics.html' target=_blank rel=noopener>Peter Junglas</a>, who were using <a href='https://mbe.modelica.university/components/connectors/' target=_blank rel=noopener>acausal connectors</a> for SD models, I became interested enough to actually learn Modelica. That, in the end, got me going.</p>
<h3>Q: Can you share some thoughts on the importance of system dynamics? Why would one be interested in modeling social systems?</h3>
<p>A: In the <a href="https://www.wolfram.com/broadcast/video.php?v=3359">introductory video</a> for the Business Simulation library, I have used two diagrams that are derived from the ones used by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hartmut_Bossel" target=_blank rel=noopener>Hartmut Bossel</a> in his <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Systems-Complexity-Dynamics-Evolution-Sustainability/dp/3833481218" target=_blank rel=noopener>introductory text</a> on modeling and simulation. Essentially, a lot of social systems in business, finance and economics or politics are too complex to be understood by treating them as &#8220;black boxes&#8221;&mdash;we need to at least make them &#8220;gray&#8221; in the sense that we observe the relevant structure of the system (e.g. its interconnectedness) and have &#8220;curve-fitting&#8221; approximations happen only at levels deeper down in our models.</p>
<p>To give a current example, we cannot fruitfully understand the COVID-19 pandemic by fitting the parameters of a normal distribution or a <a href='https://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=Gompertz+curve'>Gompertz curve</a>. If we have a total lockdown, then the system’s behavior will not look like a regular <a href='https://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=sigmoid+curve'>sigmoid curve</a>. We are well advised to model the essential processes operating within the system in order to come up with reasonable estimates regarding answers to what-if questions.</p>
<p>The pandemic exemplifies the need to “explain” actions taken by a regulator, irrespective of it being a government, a public organization or a corporation. Not doing so in a reasonable way virtually pushes people into rebellion and drives them to “alternative explanations” and “alternative facts.”</p>
<p>COVID-19 is just one example of a problem faced by society that is amenable to modeling and simulation—climate change is another good example for a much more complex problem of tremendous importance. Here again, politicians are well advised to convincingly argue their actions. The <a href='https://www.climateinteractive.org/tools/en-roads/' target=_blank rel=noopener>En-ROADS policy simulation model</a> impressively shows how system dynamics modeling can be a great way to do just that.</p>
<h3>Q: What is the Business Simulation library doing differently than existing approaches in Modelica?</h3>
<p>A: In a dedicated system dynamics software, users can add, say, four flows to a single stock very quickly by simple drag-and-drop procedures, and users can write equations for these flows simply as “parameters.” A Modelica library for system dynamics has to match this kind of ease and flexibility as far as possible.</p>
<p>The thing one needs to realize is that in Modelica, that kind of flexibility is available for <em>acausal</em> connectors, i.e. <em>physical</em> connectors, that are used to model the transition of conserved entities. The BSL is using acausal connectors, e.g. stock and flow ports, which will transmit a rate of flow <em>and</em> the current amount in a connected stock <em>at the same time</em>.</p>
<h3>Q: Can you elaborate on this? Why will a modeler care?</h3>
<p>A: Well, let’s have a look at a process that is ubiquitous in economic and ecological models: exponential growth. The “<a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%22Hello,_World!%22_program' target=_blank rel=noopener>Hello, World!</a>” dynamical system model is population growth at constant birth and death rates with one stock for the whole population. The following diagram shows how this model will look in a typical SD software package:</p>
<p><img class='aligncenter' src='https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/39/2021/02/img001.png' alt='Model' title='Model' width='404' height=' '/></p>
<p>Now let’s compare this to an equivalent model in System Modeler using the new library, which has been parameterized in a slightly different fashion using the parameter <em>lifespan</em> instead of a <em>fractional death rate</em>:</p>
<p><img class='aligncenter' src='https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/39/2021/02/img002.png' alt='Model' title='Model' width='536' height=' '/></p>
<p>In a system dynamics package, we need to draw six connections, while using the BSL we need to draw only four connections. In fact, only two connections would suffice as we can model the rate and the lifespan as parameters encapsulated with the process components (i.e. <span class="computer-voice">EXP Growth</span> and <span class="computer-voice">EXP Decay</span>) to speed up model building. The following little table shows the complete comparison:</p>
<p><img class='aligncenter' src='https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/39/2021/02/img003.png' alt='Table' title='Table' width='178' height=' '/></p>
<p>The BSL is visually much more expressive: parameter values are nicely shown in the diagram, and it is completely clear what kind of “processes” are changing the states of the system, e.g. the population size in the example. While in the BSL, modelers usually do not need to <em>write</em> equations, they also do not need to <em>inspect</em> equations to understand what is going on. For example, in the system dynamics diagram, a model using exponential decay with a given residence time would look exactly like one using exponential decline at a fractional rate. To tell the difference—and to check for modeling errors—we do need to look at the actual equations. Using the BSL, the model’s diagram contains all the information we need.</p>
<p>The whole design of the BSL underlines the similarity of business process modeling (e.g. event-driven process chains) and a strategic business simulation with regard to <em>physical</em> processes: <em>stocks</em> are shown in red like events, while <em>flows</em> appear in green like activities/functions on a process map.</p>
<blockquote class='aligncenter'>
<p>“[A] simulation model—even if it is <br />a large model—needs to fit on a single page.”</p>
</blockquote>
<h3>Q: Can I make large-scale models as well? What is the level of complexity it can handle?</h3>
<p>A: <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stafford_Beer' target=_blank rel=noopener>Stafford Beer</a>, the father of management cybernetics, postulated that any viable system will have a recursive structure: it will be a system of viable systems. The object-oriented approach in Modelica takes the same route in dealing with real-world complexity. Essentially, a simulation model—even if it is a large model—needs to fit on a single page.</p>
<p>Using the BSL, you can build arbitrarily complex models from the basic building blocks included in the library in a hierarchical fashion. The stylized model of an industrial supply chain network, shown in the following figure, may illustrate this. The complex system is shown as an interconnected system of systems exchanging conserved quantities (e.g. “matter”) and information:</p>
<p><img class='aligncenter' src='https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/39/2021/02/img004.png' alt='Model' title='Model' width='556' height=' '/></p>
<p>In that model, we can “drill down” into the model of producer <span class="computer-voice">p1</span> to discover that it again will consist of subsystems, a <em>decision-making</em><em> unit </em>(the management) and <em>operations</em>. While the management subsystem processes information for decision making, which is typically modeled by some kind of rule-based policy, the operational subsystems deal (at least to a significant part) with tangible entities and processes that transform them from one state into another:</p>
<p><img class='aligncenter' src='https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/39/2021/02/img005.png' alt='Model' title='Model' width='540' height=' '/></p>
<p>Operational processes can finally be translated into a dynamical model and, as I have demonstrated in the introductory examples shipping with the library, using pre-built components helps to speed up building larger models. In the example <a href='https://bsl-support.de/BusinessSimulation/BusinessSimulation.Examples.SimpleProductionChainIII.html' target=_blank rel=noopener>SimpleProductionChainIII</a>, shown next, the pre-built components <span class="computer-voice"><a href='https://bsl-support.de/BusinessSimulation/BusinessSimulation.MoleculesOfStructure.Actuators.Diffusion.html' target=_blank rel=noopener>Diffusion</a></span> and <span class="computer-voice"><a href='https://bsl-support.de/BusinessSimulation/BusinessSimulation.MoleculesOfStructure.Policy.FirstOrderStockAdjustment.html' target=_blank rel=noopener>FirstOrderStockAdjustment</a></span> are used to model new product adoption and production planning, respectively:</p>
<p><img class='aligncenter' src='https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/39/2021/02/img006-1.png' alt='Model' title='Model' width='441' height=''/></p>
<p>While there are presently no large live models to show yet—as the library has  just been released for the first time—it is pretty clear that it will be possible to build models that have the same scope as the En-ROADS model mentioned previously. The advantage of the library is that it will offer all the speed and maintenance advantages of object orientation.</p>
<h3>Q: Who can use the library? Does it need any prior knowledge, i.e. do I have to know some literature?</h3>
<p>A: I am convinced that the library and its pre-built components make modeling and simulation in social science applications as easy as possible. Nevertheless, it is rather abstract if you are not used to the approach of system dynamics. So, while not necessary, I would recommend some literature.</p>
<p>If you are coming from business and would like to build mainly strategic business simulations, then Kim Warren’s <em><a href='https://www.amazon.com/Strategic-Management-Dynamics-Kim-Warren/dp/0470060670' target=_blank rel=noopener>Strategic Management Dynamics</a></em> is a great book to read. A more comprehensive introduction to system dynamics modeling is given by Andrew Ford. His text is also—given its title, <em><a href='https://www.amazon.com/Modeling-Environment-Second-Andrew-Ford/dp/1597264733' target=_blank rel=noopener>Modeling the Environment</a></em>—a great place to start if you have an interest in environmental modeling.</p>
<p>While John Sterman’s <em><a href='https://www.amazon.com/Business-Dynamics-Systems-Thinking-Modeling/dp/007238915X' target=_blank rel=noopener>Business Dynamics</a></em> still is widely considered to be the definitive text on system dynamics modeling, my personal favorite for a very thorough introduction to modeling and simulation (not only) in the social sciences is Hartmut Bossel’s textbook <em><a href='https://www.amazon.com/Systems-Complexity-Dynamics-Evolution-Sustainability/dp/3833481218' target=_blank rel=noopener>Systems and Models</a></em>. In that book, you will also find some explanation for his widely acknowledged take on sustainability using orientor theory, which is implemented in the library.</p>
<h3>Q: What are your plans for the further development of the library?</h3>
<p>A: The focus with regard to this first release has clearly been on robustness. The basic library classes should (hopefully) remain as they are now. In upcoming releases, I would like to add more “molecules of structure,” e.g. typical building blocks of system dynamics models that help to reduce the development time.</p>
<p>Another avenue will be to make use of the tight integration between System Modeler and the Wolfram Language. System dynamics has a lot to gain from embracing stochastic modeling approaches—especially modern Bayesian ones. Here the workflow for using prior knowledge and incoming data to “learn” should be made as convenient as possible.</p>

<p>In the days of online learning and remote work, students are gaining valuable skills to help them navigate their education. With new needs for greater independence in their learning journeys, better time management and finding communities in unexpected places, students are already encountering important lessons. <a href='https://education.wolfram.com/summer/'>Student-centered events</a> like the <a href='https://community.wolfram.com/web/campadmin'>Wolfram Emerging Leaders Program</a> help foster success in the workplace and in life, no matter what happens in the world.<span id="more-71638"></span></p>
<p>Alongside these soft skills, more specific practices like computational thinking are at the forefront of the focused skills students need to develop in the modern world. The ability to break down problems into their component parts and to piece together a solution quickly and accurately is important for a variety of careers and pursuits in the twenty-first century. Even more important, perhaps, is that this skill enables you to express ideas clearly enough that even a computer can understand them.</p>
<h2 id='wolfram-high-school-summer-camp'>Wolfram High School Summer Camp</h2>
<p>As the director of the <a href='https://education.wolfram.com/summer/camp/'>Wolfram High School Summer Camp</a> in 2020, I was privileged to work with a group of smart, passionate teenagers as they built a variety of really interesting <a href='https://wolfram-camp.tumblr.com/' target=_blank rel=noopener>projects</a>. Camp in 2020 was a very <a href='https://blog.wolfram.com/2020/07/30/the-wolfram-high-school-summer-camp-went-virtual-and-it-was-an-experience/'>different experience</a> to camp in previous years. We had a whole new leadership team, and, of course, the entire program was remote. Our students this year were, in some ways, faced with a more challenging learning environment than in previous years, but they rose to the occasion. They built some amazing projects, learning to code and apply computational thinking skills even more thoroughly than in 2019.</p>
<p><img class='aligncenter' src='https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/39/2021/01/virtual-gathering2.png' alt='Virtual gathering' title='Virtual gathering' width='620' height=' '/></p>
<p class="figure-caption">Like the Wolfram High School Summer Camp this year, the Wolfram Emerging Leaders Program met virtually. Here is an example of a remote &#8220;gathering&#8221; where 2019 and 2020 camp alumni used interactive technology to listen to WELP&#8217;s final presentations, play games and listen to music. It was a unique opportunity to get back together with old friends and meet new people from the previous camp year.</p>
<p>At the Summer Camp, students spend the first few days each year learning how to code in the <a href='https://www.wolfram.com/language/'>Wolfram Language</a>. With the help of our specially designed curriculum, which focuses on problem solving and active learning, students get up to speed incredibly quickly. They often go from zero coding experience to wrangling their own neural nets and performing complex image processing tasks in just a couple of days.</p>
<p>Once students have mastered the raw skill of coding and have been primed on their computational thinking skills through planned activities and mini-projects, we let them loose on an independent project for the remainder of the camp. Each student works with <a href='https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2020/07/a-burst-of-physics-progress-at-the-2020-wolfram-summer-school/'>Stephen Wolfram</a> to find a project that suits them and their goals, and then, with the support of an expert mentor in their field, they take the project from a short description to a finished product.</p>
<p>For many of our students, this is the first time they have completed a complex independent project. It’s also often the first time they have been able to dedicate a serious chunk of their time to one idea, a very different learning environment to switching topics with the school bell. We have found that students flourish under this model, and in 2020, projects ranged from <a href='https://community.wolfram.com/groups/-/m/t/2033836?p_p_auth=JO6lqQts'>digital contact tracing simulations</a>, to <a href='https://community.wolfram.com/groups/-/m/t/2034637?p_p_auth=3qVMh59B'>looking for multiway systems of intermediate growth</a>, to <a href='https://community.wolfram.com/groups/-/m/t/2034599'>simulating audio with different arrangements of speakers</a>.</p>
<h2 id='wolfram-emerging-leaders-program'>Wolfram Emerging Leaders Program</h2>
<p>The Wolfram Emerging Leaders Program (nicknamed “WELP” by our students in 2019) takes a selection of the Summer Camp students and asks them to join us for the fall semester to complete a remote group project. Where the Summer Camp is a boot camp in coding, computational thinking and fast iteration, WELP is a deep dive into project work, team management, advanced coding and skill sets like design and computational thinking.</p>
<p>The first item on WELP’s agenda is to split the students into groups based on their interests, skills, goals and time zones. The focus of the program is entirely on the students and their development, so they are given very vague reasoning for why they were teamed up. For example, one group was told that they shared an interest in biology and education; they ended up doing a project focused on simulating how voters’ opinions change during an election.</p>
<p>The program is split into five key stages. The first stage is a design thinking workshop, where students learn how to come up with ideas and make rapid prototypes. The second, third and fourth stages are based partly on <a href='https://designthinking.ideo.com/' target=_blank rel=noopener>IDEO&#8217;s design thinking steps</a>: ideation, iteration and implementation. In the final stage, students work on presenting their projects: writing computational essays and preparing their presentations for our poster session.</p>
<h3 id='stage-1-design-thinking-workshops'>Stage 1: Design Thinking Workshop</h3>
<p>In the first week of WELP, students attend an afternoon of workshops focused on design thinking. This workshop helps them to discover new techniques for idea generation, design and concept building, as well as giving them the opportunity to bond with their project team. </p>
<p>We use design thinking because it empowers students never to feel judged on their ideas, creating a sense of intellectual curiosity and openness that allows even late-in-the-game thoughts to come forth as the strongest project goals. This is in direct contrast to some traditional classrooms, where students run with less-than-stellar ideas simply because they are afraid that their first idea was “wrong.” In WELP, there are no wrong ideas, only steps on the path to creating something awesome.</p>
<h3 id='stage-2-ideation'>Stage 2: Ideation</h3>
<p>The objective of the ideation stage is for each group to come up with a core goal for their project and figure out exactly what they want to achieve in WELP. Students look at problems and issues they see in the real world and try to come up with interesting solutions or explorations to fit their interests. They then try to match their goals with the capabilities of both Wolfram technologies and their own skills.</p>
<h3 id='stage-3-iteration'>Stage 3: Iteration</h3>
<p>Once their projects have been approved, the teams move on to iteration. Iteration is all about generating solutions to the problem statement identified in the previous stage. This stage motivates students to use their diverse thinking skills to come up with potentially dozens of possible solutions before choosing their favorite and sticking with it.</p>
<p>By the end of this stage, students have a minimum viable product (MVP). Throughout the process, they’ve been encouraged to do “quick and dirty” code to create weird and wonderful solutions for several of their ideas. The quality of their coding is never commented on in this phase; it’s all about the idea, the solution and the all-important skill development the students are working on.</p>
<h3 id='stage-4-implementation'>Stage 4: Implementation</h3>
<p>While their MVP goes a long way to addressing the problem they’ve identified, students focus on fully realizing a single idea in the implementation stage. By this point, they are dramatically more prepared to execute their solutions than they were at the start, having had plenty of time to experiment, fail and grow in the previous stages.</p>
<h3 id='stage-5-presentation'>Stage 5: Presentation</h3>
<p>It’s great to have a solution to a problem and to be a good coder, but none of that will get you very far unless you can present your ideas to other people. In this phase, students write a <a href='https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2017/11/what-is-a-computational-essay/'>computational essay</a>, an interactive essay interspersed with code and graphics that they can deliver to anyone in the world.</p>
<p>Students also practice for their presentations, delivered to Summer Camp alumni, mentors, Stephen Wolfram and other Wolfram Research staff members. It’s a great opportunity to show off their hard work and develop some crucial public-speaking skills.</p>
<h2 id='welp-2020-projects'>WELP 2020 Projects</h2>
<p>By the end of the 2020 program, all of the groups had produced high-quality computational essays. The variety and depth of their explorations were astounding, and the skills they developed during the program were obvious in their final products.</p>
<h3 id='using-linguistic-analysis-to-computationally-replace-given-similies'><a href="https://community.wolfram.com/groups/-/m/t/2144104?p_p_auth=5qkCwBAl">Using Linguistic Analysis to Computationally Replace Given Similes »</a></h3>
<p><a href="https://community.wolfram.com/groups/-/m/t/2144104?p_p_auth=5qkCwBAl"><img class='aligncenter' src='https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/39/2021/01/project1.png' alt='Using Linguistic Analysis to Computationally Replace Given Similes' title='Using Linguistic Analysis to Computationally Replace Given Similes' width='620' height=' '/></a></p>
<p>This linguistically oriented group worked to replace every simile in a piece of text with another contextually relevant choice of words. For example, you could type “as fast as a rabbit” into their <a href='http://reference.wolframcloud.com/language/howto/DeployToWolframCloud.html'>cloud-deployed form</a> and have “as speedy as a cheetah” returned to you.</p>
<p>A novel use of Wolfram’s text analysis, this tool is useful to writers, ESL teachers and those of us who enjoy using insult generators to roast our friends. The function returns such gems as “you are as brainsick as a possum” and “I am as beautiful as a glistening cornflower.”</p>
<h3 id='using-hexagonal-cellular-automata-to-model-flooding'><a href="https://community.wolfram.com/groups/-/m/t/2144114?p_p_auth=5qkCwBAl">Using Hexagonal Cellular Automata to Model Flooding »</a></h3>
<p>This environmentally conscious team decided to use <a href='https://www.wolframalpha.com/examples/science-and-technology/computational-sciences/cellular-automata/'>cellular automata</a> to model flooding, making a simulation that shows how water pools in places with varied elevations.</p>
<p><a href="https://community.wolfram.com/groups/-/m/t/2144114?p_p_auth=5qkCwBAl"><img class='aligncenter' src='https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/39/2021/01/project2.png' alt='Using Hexagonal Cellular Automata to Model Flooding' title='Using Hexagonal Cellular Automata to Model Flooding' width='416' height=' '/></a></p>
<p>This model was able to find locations on real-world maps where flood water would gather, a genuinely useful result in our unpredictable climate.</p>
<h3 id='political-idea-blocking-simulating-political-change'><a href="https://community.wolfram.com/groups/-/m/t/2144165?p_p_auth=5qkCwBAl">Political Idea Blocking&mdash;Simulating Political Change »</a></h3>
<p>This group took some fascinating research into how ideas spread through populations, combined it with research on how different political ideas are connected (for example, the idea that we can assume with some degree of accuracy someone’s view on gun control when told their view on abortion) and made a massive simulation of how an individual’s ideas can change based on their context. </p>
<p>Bringing in agents such as the media, politicians, influencers and political parties, this team was able to create cluster maps of ideas as they moved through the population. </p>
<p><a href="https://community.wolfram.com/groups/-/m/t/2144165?p_p_auth=5qkCwBAl"><img class='aligncenter' src='https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/39/2021/01/project3.png' alt='Political Idea Blocking&mdash;Simulating Political Change' title='Political Idea Blocking&mdash;Simulating Political Change' width='315' height=' '/></a></p>
<p>While their simulation is based on some assumptions about idea spread, those assumptions are well researched and founded in a level of political theory that is certainly not required for WELP.</p>
<h3 id='acoustic-modeling-with-generated-depth-maps'><a href="https://community.wolfram.com/groups/-/m/t/2144200?p_p_auth=5qkCwBAl">Acoustic Modeling with Generated Depth Maps »</a></h3>
<p>This team aimed to take photos of real places and simulate broadcasting audio from different locations in the image. They were able to create interesting 3D depth maps of locations, translate those maps into Boolean regions and play sound over various 3D objects. They didn’t quite manage to broadcast sound over their depth maps.</p>
<p><a href="https://community.wolfram.com/groups/-/m/t/2144200?p_p_auth=5qkCwBAl"><img class='aligncenter' src='https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/39/2021/01/project4.png' alt='Acoustic Modeling with Generated Depth Maps' title='Acoustic Modeling with Generated Depth Maps' width='279' height=' '/></a></p>
<p>This is a great example of a project that went exactly the way it was supposed to go. The students learned huge quantities of math, physics, image processing and sound engineering as well as the coveted skill of knowing when enough is enough and letting the project go. WELP is a learning experience, not a project factory, and we are far more interested in learning than in polished essays.</p>
<h2 id='takeaways-from-welp'>Takeaways from WELP</h2>
<p>I had a great time mentoring and guiding the 2020 WELP students through this program. They worked exceedingly hard to complete projects that I would have had no hope of completing at their age, and watching them develop their thinking and coding skill sets was an absolute joy.</p>
<p>As demonstrated by the 2020 projects, students learn a variety of vital skills over the course of this program. </p>
<ul>
<li>First, their Wolfram Language coding skills and their content knowledge skyrocket. This can be seen in both the differences between their Summer Camp projects and their WELP projects and between their stage-three MVPs and their final products. </li>
<p></p>
<li>Second, they gain important experience working in a remote team, which was growing in popularity even before the current pandemic limited in-person interactions. </li>
<p></p>
<li>Third, the students develop strong computational thinking skills, which will set them up for exciting academic and industry careers, granting unparalleled insights for deeper thinking and problem solving.</li>
</ul>
<p>Several of the WELP 2020 students will be attending Summer Camp 2021 as teaching assistants, so it will be amazing to see their new skills in action as they pass them on to the next cohort. As teaching assistants at the Summer Camp, they will be tasked with designing and delivering casual learning opportunities to help new students get started on their own computational thinking journeys.</p>

<p>The <a href='https://adventofcode.com/' target=_blank rel=noopener>Advent of Code</a> by Eric Wastl is a delightful annual collection of small programming puzzles released on a daily basis each holiday season. Past questions and solutions in various programming languages are available online. For example, Michael Hale provides a wonderful set of solutions using the Wolfram Language in a featured <a href='https://community.wolfram.com/groups/-/m/t/2147697'>Wolfram Community post</a>.</p>
<p>But in this blog post, our goal isn’t a comprehensive set of solutions, but rather a showcase of an <em>approach</em> (ahem: advention) to how one might solve such delightful puzzles. The approach itself and the lessons and takeaways can be helpful in using the Wolfram Language for any task in any season.</p>

<p>Let’s go through a few of the first Advent of Code puzzles, not to see what the final answer ultimately is, but to find out what the actual day-to-day process of programming in the Wolfram Language looks and feels like.</p>
<h2 id='video-killed-the-programming-star'>Video Killed the Programming Star</h2>
<p>Before we even begin, how do we plan to record our screen? Sure, we could use general screen-recording software, but those record video, track the mouse and generally take up too much space. Really, all we need is some way to take a snapshot of the screen every few seconds.</p>
<p>That may ring some bells for you. Do you hear a ringing in your ears? You should probably get it checked out. But if thoughts like <tt><a href='http://reference.wolfram.com/language/ref/ScheduledTask.html'>ScheduledTask</a></tt> or <tt><a href='http://reference.wolfram.com/language/ref/CurrentScreenImage.html'>CurrentScreenImage</a></tt> penetrated your brain, welcome to the Wolfram headspace!</p>
<p>The following function will export a screen image to a specified directory. The image will be named based on the <tt><a href='http://reference.wolfram.com/language/ref/UnixTime.html'>UnixTime</a></tt> timestamp, which is a standard concept defined as the number of seconds since January 1, 1970, in the Greenwich Mean Time time zone. The Wolfram <tt><a href='http://reference.wolfram.com/language/ref/AbsoluteTime.html'>AbsoluteTime</a></tt> timestamp is the number of seconds since January 1, 1900, in your local time zone, and is usually better for most things, but the Unix one is a shorter integer so it makes for a shorter file name.</p>

<p>This also highlights our first takeaway: follow your dreams! If certain words or phrases come to mind, if you hear whispers of possible Wolfram functions you may have once heard about, pull at that thread. Maybe you only remember <tt><a href='http://reference.wolfram.com/language/ref/CurrentImage.html'>CurrentImage</a></tt>, and you look up the help and see that that takes a snapshot from your webcam. Do not despair! The See Also section near the bottom of the function documentation page is your friend.</p>
<h2 id='me-no-want-cookie!'>&#8220;Me No Want Cookie!&#8221;</h2>
<p>One last preliminary note before our advention begins. Many sites, and the Advent of Code is one such example, require cookies or logins or other customized clickareedoo before they give up their secrets, so a plain vanilla <tt><a href='http://reference.wolfram.com/language/ref/Import.html'>Import</a></tt> may not always save the day. There are various ways of dealing with these cookie monsters, but perhaps the most general, fun and easy is to use <tt><a href='http://reference.wolfram.com/language/ref/WebExecute.html'>WebExecute</a></tt>.</p>
<p><tt>WebExecute</tt> is a powerful function that opens up a browser that can be programmatically controlled. You can tell the browser what elements to click, or you can interact with the browser manually, log in and then still be able to control it further.</p>
<p>In the timelapse programming video created from our automated snapshots, you can see an initial attempt to solve the first problem right away is interrupted when there’s no easy automated way to get the necessary input data. (Saving and then importing a file? Too manual!)</p>
<p><tt>WebExecute</tt> lets us log in to the website and then get the input data file, stripped of the little bit of HTML that’s there:</p>
<table class='InCell'>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td colspan='1' rowspan='1' class='Input'>

					<img class='' src="https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/39/2021/01/0121pmimg9.png" alt='GetAOCInput' title='GetAOCInput' width='555' height='68' />

  "&lt;" ~~ Except["&gt;"] .. ~~ "&gt;" -&gt; ""]</pre>
</p></div>
</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>There was a secret little second takeaway in that previous code. Did you spot it? </p>
<p>The documentation for <tt>WebExecute</tt> lists a lot of types of commands you can pass into the browser, such as navigating to a different page, clicking an entity or taking a snapshot of the window. But how do you get the actual raw source of the displayed page? You can always use some JavaScript to get to it, but it turns out there’s an undocumented command called <tt>"PageSource"</tt>. How can you possibly guess that? All you have to do is ask yourself WWWD: What Would Wolfram Do? You see there are commands like <tt>"PageURL"</tt> and <tt>"PageTitle"</tt> and you know such text commands follow a standard pattern in the Wolfram Language. The lesson is: try just typing what you wish would give you the answer! The Wolfram Language is consistent and predictable, so your guess could just work out.</p>
<h2 id="backpack!-i'm-not-the-map!">Backpack! I&#8217;m Not the Map!</h2>
<p>The first Advent of Code puzzle involves finding two numbers from a long list that add up to a certain target. Using rule #1 shown previously, this might trigger thoughts of knapsacks with you. The <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knapsack_problem' target=_blank rel=noopener>knapsack problem</a> along with the <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Travelling_salesman_problem' target=_blank rel=noopener>traveling salesman problem</a> and others are famous computer science problems because they seem to require a comprehensive search to answer. If any general fast solution were found, that would mark the single greatest advance in humanity of all time, yet, ironically, heuristics exist to find quick solutions in most real-world cases.</p>
<p>So, if you type “knapsack” and hit your favorite <span class="computer-voice">F1</span> key to bring up the Wolfram help, the first result is <tt><a href='http://reference.wolfram.com/language/ref/KnapsackSolve.html'>KnapsackSolve</a></tt>. Most likely you’ve never used this function before. We are about to learn that it is a magical piece of luggage, much like the purple backpack that <a href='https://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=Dora+the+Explorer'>Dora the Explorer</a> carries with her on her adventures. What does her backpack provide?</p>

<p>You can see in the video that a lot of “coding” time in the Wolfram Language is actually spent reading the help files. There are several advantages to this. First, the problem you face has likely already been solved, so why rewrite it? Often, if it’s not immediately solved by a built-in function, there’s a second or third optional parameter that will get the job done. Second, every minute you spend reviewing the <a href='https://reference.wolfram.com/language/'>Wolfram help documentation</a> is an hour of increased human capital. It will prime your memory for the future, and it will teach you new concepts. It’s a win-win! Whereas with other programming languages you may spend days looking at and comparing different confusingly named libraries only to find that they will become obsolete in a year or two, rendering all your learning useless, with the Wolfram Language everything you learn will continue to be useful forever. Notebooks in any previous version will always run, and any changes or later improvements to functionality will always be well spelled out.</p>
<p>In any case, it turns out here that we need the <em>fifth</em> way of calling <tt>KnapsackSolve</tt> to solve the first Advent of Code problem by specifying the maximum payoff, cost and item count:</p>
<table class='InCell'>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td colspan='1' rowspan='1' class='Input'>

<pre class='text' id='11_out_text'>With[{vals = {1721, 979, 366, 299, 675, 1456}}, 
 Pick[vals, KnapsackSolve[{#, 1, 1} & /@ vals, {2020, 2020, 2}], 1]]</pre>
</p></div>
</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>Unfortunately, it doesn’t seem to work for the second part of the problem, in which we are looking for exactly <em>three</em> numbers that add up to a target. The reason it doesn’t work is&mdash;it is too good! It is able to solve the associated knapsack problem with just two numbers, and there’s no built-in parameter to tell it to do worse than it possibly can. So we need a different approach.</p>
<p>In this case, that different approach is much simpler: just take all the subsets of length 3 from the list of integers and check them each in turn to see if they add up to what you want:</p>
<table class='InCell'>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td colspan='1' rowspan='1' class='Input'>
<div>

 Total@# == 2020 &]</pre>
</p></div>
</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>It works fine in this case, and of course for the simpler case of pairs of numbers, but if the list of integers became much longer, the <tt>KnapsackSolve</tt> solution for pairs would be far more efficient.</p>
<h2 id='"now-this-looks-like-a-job-for-me,-so-everybody-just-follow-me"'>&#8220;Now This Looks Like a Job for Me, so Everybody Just Follow Me&#8221;</h2>
<p>If you were to code like <a href='https://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=eminem'>Eminem</a> raps, you’d go super fast. So check out the <a href='https://youtu.be/YnW--Rv62RM' target=_blank rel=noopener>timelapse video</a> for some of the other questions. Since it’s one screenshot every 15 seconds, it takes less than a minute of video, or about 10 to 15 minutes of wall time, to casually solve each of the first few Advent of Code problems, after the initial part figuring out <tt>WebExecute</tt> and similar helper functions.</p>
<p>What are some other general lessons from this kind of quick coding exercise?</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Learn groups of functions at a time.</b> If you were to resolve in the new year to learn one Wolfram Language function per day, you’d fall further and further behind! Recently, Wolfram has started to release more than 365 new functions each year, so at the rate of one function a day, you can never catch up. Instead, try to explore entire groups of functions. They are conveniently named, so one day you might explore all <tt>Image</tt>* functions, or all <tt>Audio</tt>* or <tt>Video</tt>* functions. The guides and tutorials are excellent and consistent. </li>
<p></p>
<li><b>String functions are worth their weight in gold.</b> If you were to only learn one group of functions, <tt>String</tt>* functions would be the way to go. They are far and away the most useful functions for cleaning and dealing with text, and text is the most common kind of data you’ll encounter. There are many convenient variants, from <tt><a href='https://reference.wolfram.com/language/ref/StringReplace.html'>StringReplace</a></tt> to <tt><a href='https://reference.wolfram.com/language/ref/StringSplit.html'>StringSplit</a></tt> to <tt><a href='https://reference.wolfram.com/language/ref/StringTake.html'>StringTake</a></tt>, as well as <tt><a href='https://reference.wolfram.com/language/ref/Characters.html'>Characters</a></tt> and <tt><a href='https://reference.wolfram.com/language/ref/LetterCounts.html'>LetterCounts</a></tt> and more.</li>
<p></p>
<li><b>Loop not lest ye be looped. </b>You’ll notice not a single for, do or while loop in any of the Advent of Code solutions here or anywhere in the Wolfram Language. They occasionally have their uses, but the more “Wolframic” way of thinking is to use <tt><a href='https://reference.wolfram.com/language/ref/Map.html'>Map</a></tt>, <tt><a href='https://reference.wolfram.com/language/ref/Apply.html'>Apply</a></tt>, <tt><a href='https://reference.wolfram.com/language/ref/Table.html'>Table</a></tt> and powerful function families like <tt><a href='https://reference.wolfram.com/language/ref/Fold.html'>Fold</a></tt>, <tt><a href='https://reference.wolfram.com/language/ref/Nest.html'>Nest</a></tt> and <tt><a href='https://reference.wolfram.com/language/ref/FixedPoint.html'>FixedPoint</a></tt>.</li>
<p></p>
<li><b>Associations and rules are powerful.</b> Particularly for question 4 of the Advent of Code, which has weird custom validation rules for different parts of a passport, having a list of those rules or patterns in a single entity makes debugging and applying it much easier. In the Wolfram Language, “data” and “code” are the same thing; use that to your advantage.</li>
<p></p>
<li><b>Use simple idioms.</b> How might you see if a list contains some number of copies of a single item? There’s approximately one and a half billion ways of doing this, but one simple way is to take the <tt><a href='https://reference.wolfram.com/language/ref/Union.html'>Union</a></tt> of the list and see if it’s equal to a list containing that one single element.</li>
</ul>
<p>You can find the fast-paced video <a href='https://youtu.be/YnW--Rv62RM' target=_blank rel=noopener>here</a>, and the notebook that was created in that video is available <a href='https://www.wolframcloud.com/obj/philip/Published/aoc-01.nb'>here</a>.</p>
<p>You might want to try out some of the puzzles yourself before searching out solutions. They’re a great exercise both in learning the Wolfram Language and in learning how to learn the Wolfram Language. One fun general insight you’ll get is this: many of the puzzles can be solved with a single call to a built-in function, and almost all can be solved in a single line of code. The amazing thing about the Wolfram Language is that that insight applies not only to programming puzzles, but to real-world tasks as well!</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img class='aligncenter' src='https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/39/2021/01/hybrid-semester.png' alt='How We Navigated a Hybrid Remote Learning Environment Using Wolfram Technology' title='How We Navigated a Hybrid Remote Learning Environment Using Wolfram Technology' width='505' height=' '/></p>
<p>The past year of learning ushered in a variety of new experiences for instructors and students alike, and the <a href='https://www.westpoint.edu/' target=_blank rel=noopener>United States Military Academy at West Point</a> was no exception. In addition to masks in the classroom, reduced class sizes to allow for social distancing, rigorous testing and tracing efforts, and precautionary remote video classes, we have also needed to adjust aspects of our teaching styles. While such adjustments were voluntary, to enhance the discussion I chose to teach several lessons outside under large white tents and even in stadium bleachers to safely enable larger conversations with my cadets. Sometimes this meant carrying a large whiteboard with a tripod out to the stadium. At other times it meant putting quiz-style questions on a website so that students could submit answers via forms that were easier to grade while allowing everyone to work at a safe distance on individual devices.<span id="more-71457"></span></p>
<p>Despite the obstacles, every opportunity to develop leaders is still a privilege, and part of my journey toward self-improvement as well. I am fortunate enough to have a classroom full of motivated individuals who volunteered for the challenges of a West Point education and show up daily ready to perform. Several of my experiences (including building PDF slides of plots and other forms not mentioned here) are captured in the <a href='https://www.wolfram.com/broadcast/video.php?c=488&#038;p=3&#038;v=3259'>talk I gave</a> during the <a href='https://www.wolfram.com/events/technology-conference/2020/'>Wolfram Technology Conference</a> this past October. In this blog post, I share some of the whys and hows of our use of various tools in the <a href='https://www.wolfram.com/language/'>Wolfram Language</a> and <a href='https://www.wolfram.com/mathematica/'>Mathematica</a> to achieve our goals.</p>
<h2 id='problem-solving-process-overview'>Problem-Solving Process Overview</h2>
<p>At West Point, we are optimized for leaders of character who solve problems (find out more at the school’s website). It is in that light that every cadet receives an interdisciplinary education of which mathematics is but one important part. As part of the required math curriculum, over the past several years I have taught a combination of courses focused on mathematical modeling, calculus and differential equations to solve problems. We teach a problem-solving process that focuses on three steps.  First, we transform a real-world situation into a mathematical model. Then, we use various traditional formulas along with modern technologies to solve that mathematical model. Finally, we must interpret that mathematical solution in a way that enables our leaders to make effective decisions. (In fact, this process is very similar to other problem-solving processes, including Wolfram’s <a href='https://www.computationalthinking.org/' target=_blank rel=noopener>computational thinking approach</a>.)</p>
<p><img class='align' src='https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/39/2021/01/usma-mathematical-modeling.png' alt='USMA Mathematical Modeling Process' title='USMA Mathematical Modeling Process' width='337' height=' '/></p>
<p class="figure-caption">Graphic from the <a href='https://www.westpoint.edu' target=_blank rel=noopener>US Military Academy at West Point</a></p>
<p>When we utilize technologies like the Wolfram Language as tools to solve problems more efficiently, we free up additional time to focus on transforming the problem and interpreting the possible solutions available to decision makers.</p>
<p>Many students face significant challenges in visualizing a new concept being described, particularly in a remote learning environment. All West Point cadets are required to take a course that uses math models to apply problem-solving skills to real-world situations. With effective instructor design, <a href='https://reference.wolfram.com/language/guide/CreatingFormsAndApps.html'>Wolfram forms</a> enable students to focus on the math concept by limiting the code required to examine similar problems. </p>
<p>My own use of the Wolfram Language through Mathematica has traditionally been limited to building and plotting functions in order to better visualize both problems and their solutions. However, the COVID-19 environment shifted post–spring break classes entirely online, and I suddenly found myself seeking to enhance the visual tools I use to explain math concepts. After a deliberate and rigorous planning process, we were fortunate to be able to hold mostly in-person classes this fall. My efforts to expand my skills to include the <a href='https://www.wolframcloud.com/'>Wolfram Cloud</a> started with a desire to improve some plots by using more of the plotting options. As I began exploring more of the robust built-in documentation that Wolfram provides (for example: to get examples and ideas about the options for the function <tt><a href='https://reference.wolfram.com/language/ref/Plot.html'>Plot</a></tt>, open a notebook cell and run <tt>?Plot</tt>), I became more aware of the vast variety of functions available to Wolfram users.</p>
<h2 id='comparing-function-behavior'>Comparing Function Behavior</h2>
<p>I had previously used the <tt><a href='https://reference.wolfram.com/language/ref/Manipulate.html'>Manipulate</a></tt> command to show differences between how different functions behave. You can quickly select a different function from the drop-down menu and see how the plot changes as the value of the input variable changes. </p>

<p><tt>FormPage</tt> offers the flexibility to see the output of the form and then readjust the inputs on the same webpage. Keeping the entire problem on the same viewing screen enables students to more directly associate the relationship between changing the value of an input and seeing the corresponding effect on the output. With multiple adjustments and repetitions visualizing similar problems, hopefully students are able to discover relationships that may have been more difficult to understand using static figures alone. (Be aware that depending on what you are trying to achieve, some deployments using <tt>FormFunction</tt> and <tt>FormPage</tt> stored in the cloud can cost <a href='https://www.wolfram.com/cloud-credits/'>Wolfram Cloud Credits</a>. If that doesn’t align with your desires, you may consider just sharing entire notebooks or having students download and run the forms locally on their machines.)</p>

<h3 id='visualizing-a-scatter-plot-using-form'>Visualizing a Scatter Plot Using FormFunction</h3>
<p>Looking at examples from the documentation, it becomes clear the function <tt>FormFunction</tt> is very similar to <tt>FormPage</tt>, with the function arguments first taking the desired user-provided inputs followed by a comma, then explaining what computation must be performed on those inputs. The formatting of the output is followed by an <tt><a href='https://reference.wolfram.com/language/ref/Function.html'>&</a></tt> symbol. In the computation part of the form command, the inputs get a <tt><a href='https://reference.wolfram.com/language/ref/Slot.html'>#</a></tt> symbol in front of the name provided for that input. </p>
<p>An example more appropriate for <tt>FormFunction</tt> was when I wanted to allow students to upload a CSV file with two columns corresponding to inputs and outputs of a dataset: </p>
<p><img class='' src='https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/39/2021/01/browser1.png' alt='Browser' title='Browser' width='620' height=' '/></p>
<p>I also arranged for the Wolfram Cloud to provide a visual scatter plot of the data points using a <tt>FormFunction</tt> that included the <tt><a href='https://reference.wolfram.com/language/ref/ListPlot.html'>ListPlot</a></tt> and <tt><a href='https://reference.wolfram.com/language/ref/Table.html'>Table</a></tt> commands in the output:</p>

<p>I usually just share the website address for a notebook of what I did in class, but I had one student who for whatever reason was slow to visit any of the notebook sites I was sharing. So when he asked me for assistance with something related to a concept I had shared via posting the Wolfram Cloud website link in our LMS with the QR code the previous day, I first asked him to point his camera at the QR code. He was surprised to discover how easy it was to see an example of everything I had done the class before.

<p>Maybe you have students who ask if they can take a picture of the boards in your classroom during class. An alternative for any notebook code is just to publish it to the cloud. You may also desire to build and share a central repository of all the notebooks and objects that you share with students. A simple approach could be to build a blank notebook with all the pictures and hyperlinks to all the addresses for the cloud objects you want to share. Then run <tt>CloudPublish</tt> at the very end of the page and provide your students with that single link. You can then add and remove other objects from the page by republishing an updated notebook to that web address throughout the course. An example website of other items I worked on this semester is posted <a href='https://www.wolframcloud.com/obj/timothy.newlin/Published/Hyperlinks_MA103InstructorExample.nb'>here</a>.</p>
<p>Another way to get there is by pointing the camera on your device at the following QR code:</p>

<p>I hope you have found these many suggestions and the associated examples helpful. As students continue to learn in environments that may be remote, in person or something in between based on changing conditions, we continue to navigate the challenges of inspiring and enabling them to solve difficult problems. Regardless of the learning environment, as teachers, mentors or coaches, you have all experienced the spark of joy that occurs when you see a student realize a concept or relationship that was previously unknown to them. Whether you choose to simply publish an entire <a href='https://www.wolfram.com/notebooks/'>Wolfram Notebook</a> to the cloud to share with your class or you decide to dig into the options of the <tt>FormFunction</tt> and <tt>FormPage</tt> functions to create some new tools that enhance your class, I wish you luck and offer my support. Thanks for journeying along with me. Stay safe, and happy lessons ahead!</p>

<p>Today’s handheld devices are powerful enough to run <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neural_network#Artificial_intelligence' target=_blank rel=noopener>neural networks</a> locally without the need for a cloud server connection, which can be a great convenience when you’re on the go. Deploying and running a custom neural network on your phone or tablet is not straightforward, though, and the process depends on the operating system of the machine. In this post, I will focus on iOS devices and walk you through all the necessary steps to train a custom image classifier neural network model using the <a href='https://www.wolfram.com/language/'>Wolfram Language</a>, export it through <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_Neural_Network_Exchange' target=_blank rel=noopener>ONNX</a> (new in <a href='https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2020/12/launching-version-12-2-of-wolfram-language-mathematica-228-new-functions-and-much-more/'>Version 12.2</a>), convert it to <a href='https://developer.apple.com/machine-learning/core-ml' target=_blank rel=noopener>Core ML</a> (Apple’s machine learning framework for iOS apps) and finally deploy it to your iPhone or iPad.<span id="more-71349"></span> </p>
<p>Before we get started, an important warning: Do <b>NOT</b> use this classifier for cooking without expert consultation. Toxic mushrooms can be deadly!</p>
<h2 id='creating-training-and-testing-data'>Creating Training and Testing Data</h2>
<p> Mushroom season is still a few months away in the Northern Hemisphere, but it would be great to have a mushroom image classifier running locally on your phone in order to identify mushrooms while hiking. To build such an image classifier, we will need a good training set that includes dozens of images for each mushroom species.</p>
<p>As an example, I’ll start with getting the species entity for a mushroom, the <a href='https://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=fly+agaric'>fly agaric</a> (<em>Amanita muscaria</em>), which even has its own emoji: <span class='InlineFormula'><img src="https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/39/2021/01/emoji.png" width="20" height="20" align="absmiddle" class="inline-img"></span>.</p>

<p>Thankfully, the <a href="https://www.inaturalist.org/" target=_blank rel=noopener>iNaturalist</a> community of citizen scientists has recorded hundreds of field observations for all kinds of mushroom species.

<p>For converting an ONNX model into Core ML, we need to install two extra packages<span style="font-weight:Bold"> </span>using the terminal:</p>
<p>1. <a href='https://github.com/apple/coremltools' target="_blank"> coremltools package</a>:</p>
<p><img class='' src='https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/39/2021/01/terminal-code1.png' alt=' ' title=' ' width='' height='20'/></p>

<p><img class='' src='https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/39/2021/01/terminal-code2-1.png' alt=' ' title=' ' width='' height='20'/></p>
<p>Core ML models (.mlmodel) work similarly to Wolfram Language models. They also include an encoder and a decoder for the model. So while converting the ONNX model to Core ML, we need to specify the image encoder (preprocessing arguments) and the decoder (the class labels).</p>
<p>If we click the <span class="computer-voice">Input</span> port from our original Wolfram Language model, we will see the following panel:</p>

<p>During the conversion, we will need to specify that the input type is an image and include the mean image values for each color channel as biases. Furthermore, we will need to specify an image rescale factor since the original model pixel values range from 0 to 1 and the Core ML values range from 0 to 255.</p>
<p>coremltools allows us to specify the class labels of the model using a text file containing each class label in a new line. It is straightforward to export such a text file using <tt>Export</tt> and <tt><a href='https://reference.wolfram.com/language/ref/StringRiffle.html'>StringRiffle</a></tt>:</p>
