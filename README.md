## The Design Document

### Part 1. Your language

*Summarize key objects, types, and operators of your language:*
* select those constructs that are important for presenting your design
* illustrate features with example programs in your language
* highlight those constructs that make your language a better solution to the problem than a classical library of procedures or classes

### Part 2. Your implementation

*Describe the chosen implementation.  Answer at least these questions:*

* Will your language be embedded (if yes, shallow or deep) or external, or will it be a combination of the above designs?
* Show the diagram of your system architecture, indicating key components, and the type of data that will be read and produced by these components.
* The components could be a parser, analyzer, code generator, etc.
  * The data could be an AST, a CFG, or other IR, etc.
  * Will your system use an optimizer?
* Will you analyze the code to find some errors?
* What is your implementation language?
* How will you test the implementation of your language?
* What compiler construction tools (such as ANTLR) will you use?
* Answer other questions as necessary.  For example, you may need to answer what is your compilerâ€™s target language or API.

*Add a figure of **your implementation architecture** and refer to it from your answers.*

### Part 3. Design Rationale and Design Alternatives

*Present justification for your design choices.  For all the answers to Part 2, describe why this was the best choice. You should account for the short implementation time, and explain why given more time, you may have chosen a different option.*

### 4. Implementation steps
*Describe your implementation plan.  Design your implementation steps such that each step adds more features from your language, so that when you run out of time, you will have some subset of your language running.  Ideally, you will be able to execute some simple programs from your language already after the first step.*

*Show at least three steps.  For each step, describe what programs in your language you will be able to run after this step is implemented.*
